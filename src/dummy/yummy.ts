        "My Review": "3.5 <br/><br/>There is a dangerous line you walk with novellas. A brilliant novella never feels limited by its length. It carries you effortlessly through its story, making you laugh and cry with its characters, and builds a world so vivid it’s hard to believe it fits within just 200 pages. It is just as easy to mess up and do the exact opposite of that where you leave the reader wanting for more but for all the wrong reasons. <br/><br/>All of this is a roundabout way of saying this book fell somewhere in the middle for me.<br/><br/>The world was brilliantly built; the concept of uploaded memories and your memory extending your lifespan was so unique and the spaceship hosting an entire mini-city fully functional felt very authentic SF. Sadly, for me, what did not work as well was the mystery - it was extremely underwhelming. We spent a lot of time just learning the world since our character had been asleep for two years and was getting introduced to a lot of the new systems in place which took away from the mystery. It feels like we walk into the resolution a bit too conveniently.<br/><br/>I will continue reading the series and give it another go since I am still interested in the world but I hope the author builds out Dorothy a bit more - I'd like to learn more about her personality that does not contain like knitting and tea but more substantial stuff (like her trying out summer storm and the evocative feeling it brings with it!)",

        "My Review": "This really worked for me - i've had my eyes on this for the longest time and the only thing stopping me was how boring the first chapter was. I started this book 2-3 times and would drop it every single time because October 31st did not work for me, however, I pushed through solely because of how great the reviews were on my feed. <br/><br/>Thank god I did, because I had such a good time with it. Holly Jackson writes unique mysteries every single time which is difficult to do in an severely oversatured genre run over with tropes and she delivers every single time. This particular one had so many different little twists, some of which I guessed, others which had to be spelled out for me to get it - the book was unputdownable and the reading experience was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only redeeming characters in this book was Billy and the dog who really were caught in the crosshairs but we had an elaborate list of side characters, all of whom were given distinct personalities and felt like people as opposed to carciatures which is difficult to do in a book with so many arching plot points.<br/><br/>One other thing I loved about the book was Jet's realisation about what life means for her & how life can't be resolved by an overarching goal that always feels out of reach but chasing happiness in the little moments of your life - I feel like that is a message that will always be timeless across all stages of life.<br/><br/>My only issue was that this book did not feel like an adult thriller? If the same book was published with nothing modified except Jet's age to 17, the book would still read exactly the same. I hadn't even realised this was Holly's foray into adult thriller and while I wept into the inside of my pillow at the end, nothing about this was very *adult* thriller.<br/>",

        "My Review": "3.5 (rounded off to 3 because it is the year 2025 and Goodreads still does NOT have half star ratings)<br/><br/>This book is incredibly relevant in the current socio-political climate. One of the best done parts of this book explores Tess & Richard Welch; not only is the rallies and talks organised by Richard in the book directly inspired from the ongoing events but it also gives us this insight into not only what attracts attention and unwavering loyalty to these public figures but also the charisma & tactics employed by them to skirt the line of what is legal and illegal, inciting violence by words and overall drawing some important spotlight to the fact that words are just as bad as being the one to light the building on fire if they are unchecked. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed seeing Tess as this unwilling victim of becoming a spokesperson for the other side, having her own words controlled and set up as this beacon of worship, paralleling Richard Welch. <br/><br/>Ultimately what annoyed me is some of these plot points felt edgy for the shock factor (the parties) and a lot of the revelations came too late in the book - the Jack thread was promptly abandoned and picked right back up out of nowhere and I feel this book could have been an even more profound book if we had 1-2 threads we were following throughout vs trying to do a commentary on multiple things at once. <br/><br/>I would have also enjoyed a bit more characterisation with respect to our main character who mainly just acts as the eyes for us to view the events but we never learn enough for her to feel for her and what happens to her.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to understand the current political climate in USA.",

        "My Review": "While I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed the conversation around capitalism and how it extracts work from you until it literally sucks you dry. This is driven further by how you’re doing the same thing over and over even when you are literally fevered. It was also a love letter to New York, or at least a letter to New York, how it has been taken away from the people who made it to serve those who work in shiny glass buildings and skyscrapers. There are ruminations about the experience of being an immigrant and how Candace is the way she is because her parents asked her to be useful and that is a uniquely immigrant experience/need  alongside the whole millennial thing <br/><br/>While I get all of that, I feel like the same were a little on the nose which is fine as long as there was something going on on the plot. Up until the end, we were following the plot very well (albeit being so dull) until we had an abrupt ending, which feels very weird for the reader because we’ve been following this character we’ve been watching her move through different landscapes and the ending doesn't provide closure of any sort. Everything doesn't need to be told, yes but a plot needs to move forward - you cannot choose a midpoint on it and deign it to be the ending. <br/><br/>This book felt like it desperately wanted to provide commentary trojan horse-d as a story - a lot of it is explained away because our main character goes through life thoroughly emotionally detached from her own body & surroundings. But reducing your side characters to caricatures with no real defining features, explaining away plot holes and introducing many moving parts cannot be completely explained just with her own characterisation. I feel this book could've benefited from honing in on 2/3 themes as opposed to including everything in a fairly short book that dragged the worldbuilding and character development down. ",

        "My Review": "George Orwell is someone I’ve heard so many good things about but was always afraid to pick up something written by him due to the assumption that a classic is going to be difficult to read. When my book club picked this as the book of the month, I asked for six weeks to read it because I thought I was gonna log through it so imagine my surprise when I realised how readable this book is. due to the subject matter and what the book talks about, I really thought that it would be inaccessible when, in fact, I feel like the author made it accessible because of the demographic that most needs this.<br/><br/>1984 “imagines” a world where people are under constant surveillance and monitoring via the use of TV and print media is basically fiction that the government completely controls. The word is divided into three subcontinent who are constantly fighting, and the people in these three subcontinents live in the constant fear of war. The understanding is is that if everything can be monitored, there can be no internal attacks and you assume the government wants what’s best for you, so you give them privacy over your own thoughts until you are so propaganda-fed that you don’t know what your own thoughts are anymore.<br/><br/>[SPOILERS AHEAD - ANALYSIS OF TEXT FOR BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION] <br/><br/>Our main character works in one such faction of the government intended to rewrite history to ensure that all of what is going on is reflected in the past. The book starts from Winston, trying to write in the privacy or lack thereof in his home at writing desk, hidden from view of television on a diary, and we see our see our first glimpse of what’s wrong with this world - writing is no longer encouraged and instead, everything is dictated, making it much easier again to monitor people or what they’re saying. Similarly, English is simplified to \"newspeak\" to ensure words can only ever have one meaning and vocabulary is limited so words never make you think. Sex is reduced to an act done solely for procreation as your duty to the government/country but not necessarily something you'd approach outside of that - this is implied for two reasons: they want their citizens to be miserable; all that frustration can be channeled into projecting the same onto something else but also because physical intimacy implies freedom to express and to love - fundamental human experiences that the party doesn't want you to have because that is just a road away from realising the debilitating fuckedupness of your own situation. You are not allowed time away to be on your own - you go from work to communal recreational activity to home only for sleep and repeat; individualism invites space for reflection/thoughts. <br/><br/>Class plays an important role here as well - most of these things are only applicable to the party officials while the monitoring on proletariats is less severe, mostly restricted to propaganda that justifies their poor living conditions. People believed to be \"smart\" are often made an official, purely because it is easier to control them from the inside while proles are believed to be too ignorant to rebel - these freedoms are allowed for them as distractions to keep the content. Rewriting history helps because nothing can ever be proven otherwise making it difficult to incite reasonable doubt for a riot. <br/><br/><i> \"If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable when then?\" </i> <br/><br/>In Part 2, Winston performs his singular act of rebellion by getting into a relationship with Julia - we seem them reclaim their own humanity and agency with this affair (I loved it for them). We also get some excellent commentary via Julia of apathetic activists who themselves are in a better off condition than the thing they're against - she is someone who only pushes back when directly affected. Orwell seems to use her to critique a certain kind of political apathy: the person who grumbles about injustice but doesn't engage in systemic resistance.<br/><br/>Winston believes that while the Party can control actions and thoughts outwardly, it can’t reach the core of a person’s self - their private feelings and loyalties. This line of thought is ultimately challenged and demolished presenting the ultimate truth - human spirit is not immovable when alone (hence the isolation during torture) and can be broken down until you're a shell of a person you were, looking onto your torturer as also your savior ultimately letting yourself be brainwashed. <br/><br/>While the monologue dedicated to breaking down the 3 slogans of the Party definitely dragged on and suspended into a full blown Orwell rant, the critique Orwell makes throughout of class structure and. power as a form of control is still relevant. In earlier times, inequality was explained as a necessary evil for the greater good. But in Oceania, the Party no longer pretends that inequality serves a higher purpose. <br/><br/>Big Brother is employed as a farce by the Party as sort of a mythical figure that inspires fear & loyalty, it is much easier to worship a singular person than an entire group of people behind it, this allows people to project onto him an image of who they want him to be (parasocial relationships). He becomes whatever the people want him to be to worship him.<br/><br/>We are also left debating if Winston in love with Julia - it feels like he knows things logically but doesn't feel them since he has eroded away all human emotions as a byproduct of working for the party. In Part 3, the downfall (& all hope I had for a revolution fades) as Winston faces torture. While not the ideal hero-saves-the-world story, this is the more realistic route since a singular person cannot overthrow a totalitarianism society - there can be no one hero. ",

        "My Review": " I wanted to like this book more than anything else, and this DNF disappoints me. Gillian McAllister with her wrong, place wrong time, came at the best time for me as a reader who was tired of the basic, thriller storylines. However, with famous last words, the book did not live up to the premise. It actually started quite strong.  Part one was so incredibly fast-paced that I was rushing through the book to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>However, part two sucked out all of the momentum from the book. If you were to read part one part two a month apart, I don’t think you could tell that they from the same book. Part two takes place seven years post the hostage situation where Luke is now missing and we follow Camilla and Niall, both battling their own set of demons - we see Camilla on a date where she gets an anonymous text message and all she cares about is is that the fact that it might be Luke. I understand that this is a love story but there are very few women who do not have resentment and anchor harboured towards their partner, if they abandoned them with a newborn baby, and no parting words, and no explanation. This did not feel like a realistic depiction of that specially with the way that Camilla had been characterised so far. It rang so false where she sees Luke everywhere and she still so in love with Luke which she makes sure to tell every two sentences. Niall, on the other hand, was also suffering from night terrors, and his unresolved case, and his wife left him over that case, so like a typical detective backstory.<br/><br/>Around this point is when I stopped reading the story because I figured they would be some sort of absolution coming for Luke, some sort of explanation why he did what he did, or we have Camilla run away with Luke because it’s a love story and honestly none of the prospects sounded interesting to me. Especially with the pace at which the book was going, I could not soldier through it.",

        "My Review": "3.5/3.75<br/><br/>This was an incredibly entertaining book, let’s get that out of the way. It took inspiration from the mysteries of yesteryear, most notably Agatha Christie and it delivered a product that was so incredibly unserious yet entertaining.<br/><br/>I have come to realise that with Riley Sagar, it’s always either hit or miss and sometimes even when it’s a hit, it’s really a miss, but I ignore it because his books are all so fast pacedso somethings always happening.<br/> <br/>The main character, Anna, is genuinely making the worst decisions at every single turn. She spends ALL her money on this train journey to gather all these criminals that have killed hundreds of people in the past, and she determined to let them all suffer with no concrete plan as to how and she is so surprised when one of these criminals does something egregious. Fork found in the kitchen much? What works here is that Anna is very much like an average person. She is not shown even in her past to have any deal capabilities that would differentiate her from other people, and we see her solely driven by sorrow, and urge to take revenge on these people that have ruined her life.<br/> <br/>The killer was so incredibly obvious from the get go. We knew who it was like you had to have known that if a character pops out out of nowhere in the book and is revealed to be the mysterious seventh person, and all of these murders are happening in between who do you think it is?<br/><br/>The way you approach this book is to just turn off your brain and have a good time because the instant you start thinking too much about everything and how things lineup so coincidentally you won’t have a good time. It’s completely unserious and I refuse to look at it any other way which contributed to the rating.<br/><br/>What did however bring the reading down is how terrible the writing is. I understand that you are taking a very cliche concept and you were trying to do something that honours it while bringing something to the table, but why did it read like Riley had roots in wattpad? there were so many instances where the book did not read like a book, but a parody of what they think a book should be like, and what a character should be feeling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "My Review": "4.5 <br/><br/>This was a mystery/crime fiction unlike any I've ever read which is a tall claim. The timelines felt incredibly realistic and the investigation slogs on over months which feels very true to a police procedural. 1960s Japan is a timeframe I had no idea of but Matsumoto was able to paint a picture of it so thoroughly via Imanishi's travels - we start in the developing metropolitan city of Tokyo contrasted by rural areas in decline, cities like Osaka and Kyoto rebuilding themselves post war. <br/><br/>Matsumoto Seicho’s Inspector Imanishi Investigates is a page-turner which picks up around the 50% mark. The narrative switches between Imanishi's investigation alongside the young Yoshimura who are quickly closing in on the facts of the investigation and beginning to ask uncomfortable questions about the men that make up the Nouveau Group. The pace is fast and the complexity of the plot leavs you hanging for more. This is contrasted by glimpses of Imanishi's life aided by scenes from his home life (his wife is a saint), his special interests (bonsai and haiku) and lush descriptions of the places he sees during his official and unofficial trips.<br/><br/>This mystery was a perfect \"slice of life\" mystery for me in a way we don't see anymore - more often than not, all mysteries seem to increasingly be categorised into \"cozy\" or \"thrillers\". Inspector Imanishi Investigates steps outsides these genre confining boxes defining its own niche with a police procedural fit for an early 2000s detective show. <br/><br/>Matsumoto does an excellent job of misleading his readers and for once, I was totally fooled - I had fallen into the red herring he laid out.

        "My Review": "Just like my rating (3.5), I lie somewhere in the middle of all of the gushing and damning reviews this book has received.<br/><br/>It is incredibly important to acknowledge the meteoric rise of technological companies that aim to both influence user purchasing patterns, opinions and also sell the same to third parties for their own undisclosed use. The understanding of technology offered as a product is largely limited to \"allowing  users to connect and communicate\" or \"purchase goods\" but in the recent years, it has become clearer and clearer that data privacy is a bigger concern - nothing is truly erased off of the internet and we need to be more cognisant of the sites we engage with.  Everything we do is \"tracked\" to optimise engagement and have the product be \"addictive\" by nature. While that is a concerning pattern, we also need to acknowledge the other elephant in the room : lobbying. A lot of technological companies lobby governments for their own political reasons to forward their own business. At the end of the day, we are consumers and the apps we use are maximising profit, by hook or crook. Often times, such things are not obvious or transparent and we often forget about it, I know I do.<br/><br/>This book is incredibly important with respect to urging readers to acknowledge the reality we live in and the role technology plays in every aspect of our global proceedings right now. It is a call to be more aware as consumers and ultimately, highlights the lack of regulations and how much we still don't understand about technology especially with rapidly increasing technological advancements.<br/><br/>With that being said, the author is an incredibly frustrating narrator - the book suffers from lack of editing with chapters on & on drawling about the same points. In her early days at Facebook, she struggles with saying no and feels liberated when her husband helps her cope with the same but what she struggles with are inane requests ANYONE should be able to say no to. At the same time, it's difficult to ignore her own role in all of this - her work speaks less of one that does policymaking and more so seems to focus on building political relationships with governments around the world to ultimately \"sell\" Facebook as a service. That does not feel like policymaking to me. I respect her for the courage to throw her NDA in the water and reveal not only the external but internal decision making aspects of Facebook. However, Sarah never seems to realise she is also a Careless Person and just as complicit in the instances she reproaches her colleagues for - the only difference is she got out and chose to speak about it.<br/><br/>",

        "My Review": "Remarkably Bright Creatures is a book that has been on my radar for a while - everyone around me seemed to love it but something about the cover dissuaded me. Goodreads has started a reading challenge where you collect bookmarks via fulfilling criteria for each of those bookmarks – I understand it for what it is but it's fun nonetheless and it prompted me to read this book.<br/><br/>My expectations and understanding about RBC was way off - I went in to this, thinking it's a plot-filled book with a mystery at its core (Eric somehow is alive was my best guess) and it completely flipped all of that on its head. <br/><br/><i> Very slight spoilers </i><br/>The book very quickly establishes a couple of things - <br/>1. Eric is very much dead.<br/>2. We follow two characters (Tova and Cameron) who live in completely different states with starkly different lives but it is consistently implied that their lives are tangled in some way.<br/>3. Marcellus can speak but he is also nearing his full age as an octopus.<br/><br/>In a way, there is no mystery to be discovered because the book presents most of its facts upfront and the rest of it feels very obvious but the charm is hidden, not in the plot (of which there is arguably little of) but the <i> vibes </i><br/><br/>Tova's sections were my favorite - her character has a lot more depth and being in her head established the setting so much better for me. Her lived experiences, emotions and thoughts felt so authentic to her character and her approach to life genuinely made me smile. I loved all the people she had in her life and the way they approached their friendships and relations to other people - it made me hopeful for an old age where I foster similar friendships. It was incredibly tender to read about and moved me to tears multiple times - her pain was very real and so was her happiness at all the obscure little things in her life. <br/><br/>When Janice said - \"That's your problem, assuming it's a burden\", it felt such a throwaway way of saying a lot in very little. Tova lives her life, isolated from others, afraid to let her guard down over the sorrow she still feels with the death of her son and husband. She presents herself as someone fiercely independent and steely but it's so reassuring to know that there are people who still look out for her, who don't consider her a burden and who go out of their way to \"trouble\" themselves for her.<br/><br/>Marcellus had me immediately captivated - he had astute observations about humans and like seemingly everyone else that read this book, I researched about Pacific Octopuses and became fascinated about all that the sea hides from us in plain sight. He was both funny and serious at the same time and his entire journey, though sparse, made my heart soar.<br/><br/>Cameron was meh - he was okay to read about and he definitely has a character development for the better in our book version of Stars Hollow but boy, was he insufferable and entitled at the big age of 30. He blamed everyone else for the way his life turned out, felt he was entitled to his dues despite so many having it so much worse and also the constant objectification of his to-be love interest felt really weird and out-of-place in the book tonally.<br/><br/>",

        "My Review": "4.5<br/><br/>Okay, so truth be told, I always check the reviews first before writing a review for creative inspiration and mostly because I often forget the nitty gritty of what I read a month post reading it - this book seems to be super polarising, I saw so many extremes which, in hindsight, does not surprise me. <br/><br/>Thankfully, I had a great experience reading this - I often view romances with a side eye because more often than not, romances don't work out for xyz reasons but often, at least once in a year, I try to find a romance I genuinely love. This book was one that I approached with that mindset but it was so much more than just a romance - tagging it as a romance would be discounting what it did with the rest of its cast. I truly enjoyed the premise of it; that is a major reason I picked it up - I love Office Gossip and the idea of knowing everything everyone is saying was so satisfying<br/><br/> but I loved how feel-goody this was in terms of -<br/>1. Find out what everyone is saying about you.<br/>2. Get mad and convince yourself this reaffirms your own beliefs about everyone else.<br/>3. Come up with a plan to be better at your job because you can't afford to get laid off<br/>4. Shocker, you spend more time with your colleagues and learn they're real people.<br/><br/>I loved the relationships that Jolene forms with people in her team, the office idiosyncrasies and cheered Jolene for the plan she came up with at the big meeting and I especially loved her dynamic with Cliff. <br/><br/>I remember texting my boyfriend that the relationship between Cliff and Jolene was such a slowburn - they only kiss once and you feel so frustrated right alongside them but I enjoyed reading about two adults who acted like adults. Often times in romances even with a couple in their 30s, the text reads so unbelievable - they abandon all their responsibilities and slip into a life of just their partner (seven days in june, I am looking at you) while with this, the characters felt really grounded who were trying to address their attraction while still having an active life outside of it. I found Cliff a very fun character to read about; we don't spend too much time on how attractive he is and the author spends a lot of time fleshing out his personality and giving us enough time between Jolene and Cliff to feel the tension in how they interact + their compatibility. All of this made their relationship so much fun to read about. <br/><br/>I would say, I didn't care much for the arc with Armin - it felt too long and stretched on forever but I enjoyed the look it gave into Parsi families (very similar to desi families, who would've thought?)<br/>",

        "My Review": "This was such an interesting short story - every single time I read a book from Kurt Vonnegut, I am struck by the impossibility of how accurately he imagined the modern landscape of a world he'd never live to see. <br/><br/>This story was a little odd in terms of the 14 year old and the empress he chose but overall, without delving into semantics and specifics, this acutely reminded me of the time 2 months ago when the ghibli trend from AI generated images took over the internet. Ethical implications of commodifying a painstakingly hand drawn franchise aside, a lot of people took to the internet to talk about how art deserves to be accessible and they deserve to be able to enjoy art and \"draw\" what they would like - the concepts in this story struck me oddly similar to that sentiment i.e. People should be equal regardless of whether they have put in the effort or not to build their expertise on that skill. Kurt Vonnegut had dreamed of a world where we would be provided impediments by the government to level the playing field - the world we live in achieves the same but by providing us enablers to move further ahead than we ordinarily would have. Why do we believe in our existence being of utmost importance that it entitles us to access things we've never worked for? \"Art should be accessible\" - tools to create art traditionally should be accessible but tools to generate art copying distinctive art styles of individuals who've spent years honing their craft shouldn't even exist, let alone be accessible.<br/><br/>I also love how clouded in mystery Harrison is - the entire book seems to be hinting at Harrison sort of saving the world and overthrowing the government to free people of the shackles that hold them back but Kurt turns this on its head by making Harrison just as bad of an evil who is ready to create a ruling class and establish a hierarchy for those who get to be freed of their impediments vs who don't which, while directly opposing egalitarianism, is still not the answer",

        "My Review": "this book was so terrible, like I need to take a minute, because I have not DNFed a book so quickly - the whole set up of getting this young kids hopes up with a woman who is clearly his teacher with talks of becoming his mother was so fucking weird - it was clear to me that she had no idea what she was doing and she just wanted to adopt a child to work out her own trauma through this kid and that’s not how parenthood works. The Social Security worker had an amazing point about how Lucy cannot just bring someone up based on love. You also need stability when you’re bringing up a child and she had none of that she was living apartment with five other people. She had no means of transportation, no contacts in terms of primary doctor and no way to fund his further education - it was so disingenuous and fucked up for her to then go on blaming the world for not letting her be with a random kid from her school instead of realising exactly why they were being prudent about it.",

        "My Review": "This very much fulfilled what it set out to do. As a thriller, Tell Me What You Did fulfilled exactly the highs of the genre.<br/><br/>The premise was honestly very unique to me. I love the idea of a podcast which typically involves mixed media this book managed incorporate to all of those elements very well. I especially loved the links of video recordings presented as evidence in between the book - that added another layer to it. The mystery in itself was very interesting -  at the core of this book what we are really exploring is whether the killer is who he says is. If you go one level deeper, it’s also about whether we should be taking matters into our own hands and what to do when the system fails you.<br/><br/><br/>With all of that being said is why I give this book 3 star rating because it managed to keep me engaged and rushing through the audiobook and the e-book in three days straight. I would’ve liked to see more of would be the momentum that we had in the first 30% of the book - that was incredibly fast paced and kept me at the edge of my seat honestly, but the more we got into the second half of the more things slowed down and honestly felt like they were repeating at some point - we were having largely the same conversations with different people and exploring different perspectives of what Poe had done from people in life. I would’ve also liked it if we had maybe explored a bit more about Hindley and about who he was just to freshen things up a little and not rehash over Poe’s life story so much. <br/><br/>Maybe an anonymous perspective of the killer where we don’t know whose perspective are we getting would have been fun and sort of contributed to the main theory - I feel at about 70% I was able to start putting things together which feels like a mystery well executed. Lastly, I loved that while Poe was drunk for most of the book, but we still didn’t have the unreliable narrator which is an overdone trope at this point",

        "My Review": "this book is an emotional rollercoaster and honestly it'll probably take some time to recover from it but if anyone asks me to recommend a book, it will probably be beartown - not only is it a character study, but also a study on the readers because honestly how you react to certain scenes and characters can say a lot about you as a person.",

        "My Review": "(don’t necessarily rate memoirs and the 4 stars is not a reflection of how much i enjoyed the memoir but moreso an admiration for sharing her story & taking her power back)<br/><br/>to read about everything in this book made my skin crawl - there is only so much a human can tolerate in their lifetime, and these kids have tolerated and seen so much more than kids should ever have to see. this book serves as a good reminder in times like these about the dangers of commodifying your child’s life where we are seeing products of family vlogging finally turn into adults who can talk about their story.<br/><br/>Parents vying to be influencers need to do a better job of protecting their kids and not using farming their kids lives for content. The story of 8Passengers goes further beyond that tho; Ruby Franke is a product of her childhood & unresolved trauma further amplified by her life partner who chose to stay blind to everything that was happening and Jodi, who aided in the absolute destruction of the family in guise of therapy.<br/><br/>It is almost terrifying to see the levels to which Ruby was already exhibiting science of physical abuse alongside emotional even when her eldest were at a young age and the worst part is that reading excerpts from when Ruby was a YouTuber, despite not having seen their content before, as a normal viewer, I bet I could not have even figured that something was amis, with what Ruby was saying re her parenting ideologies which makes it worse because child abuse becomes that much harder to detect.<br/><br/><br/>Reading parts where Jodi was introduced was especially painful seeing the level of gaslighting, and self doubt  that she was integrating into the lives of everyone who were in vulnerable positions looking to better themselves and trusted her with their feelings. The part where Shari speaks about how Jodi is truly masterful at what she does; how we think we would he immune to it until we actually encounter about is a tale in caution about not letting yourself fall into an echo chamber to protect yourself from cults especially those guised under wellness.<br/><br/><br/>To end with, I hope that the author and all the kids involved are able to process the lifetime trauma and move forward untangling the deeply ingrained thought process of denigration from their mindset. I hope the author is also able to recognise the role their own echo chamber of a community played in perpetuating the beliefs that ultimately turned on this family.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a commentary on how our system continues to fail us - How can multiple reports to the CPS go unnoticed and be dismissed due to the lack of evidence? Child abuse is not always visible and the system needs to do a better job of protecting children who are the most vulnerable to abuse under the hands of their parents.",

        "My Review": "4.5 <br/><br/>this book was quite literally unputdownable. I started it off, thinking I would read 30 pages or so and go to sleep but I ended up reading the entire thing in one go. a testimony to the world that the author has created with the forever desert trilogy. My experience with the story of Osi was incredibly enjoyable - even moreso than the first one. Due to the established world, the author was able to pack this novella with a lot more plot and events in comparison to the first. The lore we do have in this book is all interspersed as part of the plot told in bits and pieces.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the callback to the story of Tutu and the way, the author crafted that story to transform with the upcoming generations, showing how histories often rewritten by those in power to support their own agendas, and cannot be trusted at face value. The people of the City of Truth have made the downfall of Tutu as the governing principle of their life, living in constant fear of the cult of the aleke - never once questioning the figure or how the increased taxes have not led to any more safety than before.<br/><br/>Moses is not afraid for his characters to be broken not just in spirit but also in body - this is particularly new for me in fiction wherein typical fantasies will have the main characters incur war with no real serious injuries or blemishes to their body. With the injuries that are character sustain, it increases the stakes a lot more and brings to reality the fact that at the ground level of every war are citizens who have been fed a doctrine from a very young age and sacrifice their lives while the ones in power sit comfortably watching it all unfold and having it all play out for them.<br/><br/><br/>The only place where the book fell flat for me, was the ending, which kind of came out of left field. I can understand the shock value that it brings to the book and how it turns the situation on the reader who think they can predict the ending. But due to the lack of any thing that would hint at it, it truly felt like it was only placed due to the shock value. My only redemption with the ending would be the fact that we know that the suppose bad guys are the ones who hold the truth & every war starts off with two sides, both of whom  think they are right. <br/><br/>Lastly, I enjoyed Osi as a character I enjoyed how he was and how he had a lot of growing up to do just like tutu -  he believed in a very idealistic view point of the world where things are right and wrong implicitly but sometimes that’s not the case, and he does go on to learn that the world does run in many shades of grey<br/> ",

        "My Review": "4<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and read this book. With a page count of under 100, 'The Lies of the Ajungo' took me by surprise with a masterclass in creating an intricate mystery, satisfying world building and a fable at its heart. It is in and of its own a feat to write a complete story within this page count and Moses Ose demonstrates the same so brilliantly in this novella - the author manages to pack in action, adventure and twists - truly displaying that you don't need a 350 page count for an immersive experience.<br/><br/>My expectation with this book was of a young boy going out into the desert, honing his skills, meeting friends along the way & the ultimate showdown with the root of evil ('Ajungo') bringing glory to his people and while all of that did happen, it materialised in an entirely unexpected manner. The core of this story lies in forcing the readers to question their biases, what we interpret when presented with a situation and ultimately how nothing is as it seems. <br/><br/>Every word in this book is so intentional, each character and their place in the story is so important inching Tutu and the reader to the truth with just the right amount of foreshadowing.<br/><br/>|| SPOILERS || <br/>If I were to analyse this book, in a way, the mechanisms employed here mirror the real world - promoting infighting between people, atrocities performed in the name of a greater evil that no one has ever seen & the clear class divide between the rich & the poor - it's not difficult to see the motivation behind the book. Our world today is not too different from the one in The Lies of the Ajungo - we go through our lives paying our own 'tax' in exchange for 'water' albeit the water itself may be meagre or just enough for us to not complain, we live in the shadows of the ones in power who makes these decisions on our behalf and we fight amongst ourselves to prevent unifying against real evil.",

        "My Review": "dnf @ 60%<br/><br/>Time Loop Science Fiction with a romance subplot sounded like a few sets of phrases specifically curated to catch my attention and boy, did it. I first heard about this book via a youtube video late at night when I was falling asleep and ten minutes later, I had the book available on my Books app.<br/><br/>A Quantum Love Story starts off with the pov of our mmc, Carter, taking us about his week, what he knows of the world so far and his first encounter with our FMC, effectively setting the atmosphere and environment we find ourself in. From thereon forth, the book switches to the FMC POV and we roll. But what I learnt from the book is that the need of doing something different every loop so you don't realise at the sheer boredom of it all is exactly what reading about a time loop may do.<br/><br/>The worst part about a time loop story is that it is exactly what it sounds like - every chapter sounds the same, has varying degrees of repetitiveness and the reader leaves with one new variable learnt about or introduced to bring the plot forward. With all that being said, I was nerding out so hard about the Particle Accelerator - my boyfriend was obsessed with one for years so I, by proxy, was excited about reading it in a book. The Sci-Fi aspect of this was right up my alley and with the added suspense of finding out exactly was going wrong, the plot for the first 25-30% was very smooth sailing - we were gathering information about the explosion and the new characters introduced kepy the flow going. The issue, ofcourse, is due to our mcs being the only ones that retain information, new characters have to begin all the development from the ground up each loop requiring all the responsibility of any banter to fall to the only two people who would get screentime in the book alongside our AI assistant. <br/><br/>In a perfect world, this book would have employed the friends to lovers trope to place the readers amongst MCs who are already comfortable with each other & have a degree of banter/familiarity (think the vibe of <i>Happy Place</i> wrt to established familiarity) but with a strangers to lovers trope which requires a lot of development from the author in any scenario, it clashes with the titular idea of the time loop - with two big ideas both of which need screentime to move the plot forward, the pace was thrown off for the development of each of these - we would go 3 chapters with a focus on scifi alongside mentions of lingering gazes and heartfelt moments that did the work of telling us the characters were falling in love but due to lack of pages to let that develop organically, the romance always felt off and the scifi got sidetracked due to the same.<br/><br/>The personalities felt very 2 dimension (again probably due to the lack of page space) with each main character hooking onto one/two traits and overusing it to the point of abuse - at some point, it's like \"yeah, we get it, he's a foodie\"<br/><br/>I believe that if these had been two separate books, I would have loved it. On the bright side, I enjoyed Mike Chen's writing very much and will definitely be picking up another book by them.<br/><br/>Recommended for readers who enjoy reading about food (all the conversations rang so true and heartfelt for someone who also loves cooking), learning to let go and dealing with grief admist a world-ending (not rlly) people-killing rip-in-the-time-space-time-loop explosion",

        "My Review": "revised rating to 4.5(1) <br/><br/>Fahrenheit 451 took me for a ride with its beginnings so disappointing I practically abandoned the book for 2ish months and only the flurry of the news in US right now + a youtube video motivated me to start it again. Luckily, the book turns around and honestly was a delightful reading experience. <br/><br/>I had the displeasure of learning Branbury's intentions when writing F451 - primarily written to boo critics who had pointed out the racist/sexist & xenophobic text in is prior book and believing the outrage was indicative of a future of censorship where nothing polarising could be written without it offending someone. <br/> <br/>I don't agree with Branbury's motivation and choose to view F451 in isolation of his own views because of how important the text is with respect to current times. I feel so strongly about the future he envisioned coming to life for the wrong reasons - we live in a time of depleted media literacy, a time where AI influencers are very rampant and ragebait is continually used as as a tool of capitalistic brands to farm engagement for their brands. We do live in a world where books are targeted by hostile governments - you cannot control a book or the intentions an author may communicate in his text and ultimately the personal interpretation the audience takes away from it and ultimately, we want to replace all of that with media that can be much more easily controlled.<br/><br/>This isn't just limited to book banning but the simplification/rampant summaries of books, we'd rather SparkNotes/ChatGPT our classics than actively engage with the material of our book. Popular influencers who've built their platforms on reading complain about having to read paragraphs. W<br/> Between the book-burning and discouragement of education and learning, we’re well on our way to creating a reality way too similar to the world of the book. F451 plays with a lot of themes - we often only associate censorship with the book however, themes explored in relation to social media (TV), the need for people to move on from one thing to another with no real reflection and how quick gratification ruins literacy/thinking is incredibly relevant on a more personal level across people.<br/><br/>Bradbury has a quote which encapsulates it best - censorship didn't affect the society, they stopped reading of their own accord (presumably moving to better mediums such as TV/summaries) <br/><br/>We are at as much of a danger from censorship from the government as we are to the dangers of falling prey to trends of brain rotting and doomscrolling, refusing to be intellectually challenged by the media we consume day in and out, boxing ourselves into our comfortable echo chambers with the sameness of our opinion everywhere. We are the danger to books as much as the looming threat of banned books.<br/>",

        "My Review": "<b> 5 stars rounded </b><br/><br/>yes, i am done so i feel like i should do a story-by-story review of the anthology to truly hone in for the essence for when i read this review later.<br/><br/><b> <i> thoughts : overall </i></b> <br/>i really like it. i am not going to oversell it and say there are no lulls when there are - not every story is as well-written but every story is so fucking brilliant. part of the appeal for this book for me is just the humor and metaphors in each story - bojack horseman is a testament to the sort of dry humor i enjoy, the slow but eventual reveal of what the creator wants to tell you and lines delivered both direct and indirect that make me feel so seen and understood for a minute so i am not surprised this work is making me feel the same.<br/><br/><b> <i> salted circus cashews, swear to god </i></b> <i> 5 stars </i><br/>this is not a short story, at least i don't think so. to be honest, i am not too sure what clarifies as a story here but i think of this as the introduction to the entire book. this piece is most direct in what it's trying to convey - an allegory on relationships and how love is essentially putting blind faith into someone who might as well be a stranger, trusting them to treat you well and hoping this doesn't lead to heartbreak. most young adults have been through the cyclical facade of love - falling in and out, exhausted by yet another attempt at understanding another human and being disappointed when you find yourself crying over the same person who once gave you butterflies. it takes a fool to not turn a cynic in times like this, constantly cautious of what this new person could be in another day, week, month or year's time and you want to believe all their promises but somewhere deep down, you know these promises are the same one you make to others with no knowing if you can back them up in the future. god, i love this so much i could write a whole essay on the clever symbolism of the use of 'snake in a can' gag and marketing pitch to allude to vulnerability in relationships and the leap you essentially take, not knowing if you'll have a safe landing or if you'll fall in the cliff below. <br/><br/>here are my favorite excerpts from the piece below : <br/><blockquote><i> Maybe you are right to be cautious. You have been lied to before, after all. Your heart is weathered and scarred, mishandled by many, eroded by time.  You’re no dummy, and yet repeatedly, you stumble over the cracks of your cobblestone heart, you let your naked foolish hopes get the better of you. <br/> And every time you discover the cruel fiction of the cashew can, you swear to yourself you’ll trust a little less next time, you’ll be a little less open, a little more hard. It’s not worth it, you say. It just isn’t worth it. You’re smarter than all that. From now on, you’re going to be smarter. Well, I’m here to tell you that this time will be different, even though I have absolutely no evidence to support that claim. Open this can and everything will be okay. </i></blockquote><br/><br/><b> <i> short stories </i></b>  <i> 3 stars </i><br/>this was okay. nothing to write home about, we are presented with 10 loosely related vignettes that present to us the inherent contradictory and absurd nature of dating. some of these were so apt to my life at the moment and heartbreaking that it felt like a tumblr post you find at random which suddenly describes all the feelings you've had in perfect sentences while others were cliches and jokes you'd hear in a bojack horseman episode, oh wait, of course they were. my favorite was the audible narrators for these - with the specific ones they narrated, i felt we had an inkling to a larger story the readers weren't seeing because they were focused on the lies of it all.<br/><br/>my favorites (by which i mean they feel like a specific callout to me) - <br/><blockquote><i><br/>4. She told him she loved him and cared about him, and he was so dizzy in love himself he didn’t realize she was breaking up with him.<br/>8.He had this really amazing party trick where sometimes he could go a full hour without even once being suddenly reminded of the paralyzing truth that his life was finite and unrepeatable.<br/>9. It occurred to her that she loved the idea of her husband and children and all her friends and her job and her life. She loved the idea of everything.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><b> <i> A Most BLESSED and AUSPICIOUS OCCASION </i></b>  <i> 4 stars </i><br/>this was hilarious. the satiricial take on wedding culture and the absurdity that comes with it in the form of relatives, weird traditions and expectations was so apt for someone who's grown in a desi family where the couple essentially gets no choice and has to go along with their family witnessing a definite exhaustion of their budget and gossip of everything and the one thing that always has to go wrong.  it is peak bojack humor (can we get a counter for the amount of times i type bojack in this one review?) in the way it's so over-the-top with characters who'd much rather be doing anything else and the weird shame that comes in these situations and the hiliarity in the mundane and the absurd of it all. i just think if someone's never been to a wedding, they could read this and understand the ins-and-outs of weddings which is pretty great.<br/><br/><b> <i> Missed Connection- m4w</i></b>  <i> 3.5 stars </i><br/>a story in the form of a craigslist missed connection ad and what happens when your inability to act on your feelings leaves you on the cusp of something great, almost in your hands but not quite. i don't think there was a lot to it being pretty straightforward but i recognised the frustration brimming in my mind as more and more time passed and the two made no effort to converse with a varied list of excuses at their disposal such as 'too much time had passed, i didn't know what to say anymore' and this frustration is probably something every 3rd person can feel when someone is so very clearly pining over someone else, as i have done, but don't act on it. my favorite line probably was - And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for sixty years and yet still not really know that person at all.<br/><br/><b> <i> The Serial Monogamist's Guide to Important New York City Landmarks</i></b>  <i> 3.5 stars </i><br/><br/>The concept of this isn't all too original, I reckon, I've read quite a few like this piece but it was incredibly well-written in the same snarky style i've come to attach with raphael. beyond that, i am a sucker for stories about people who attach memories to places and objects with people in their life, especially those who are no longer a part of it and the very real descriptions of how if you do it enough, you'll soon find yourself in a ghost town where every other place has a memory attached to it and a whisper of the person you once used to be and the person you once loved - it's exhausting and tiring and saps at your emotional energy. <br/><br/><b> <i> We Men of Science </i></b>  <i> 5 stars </i><br/>i really liked this - of course, it was no salted circus cashews but it was science-y, multiple universes and had cats so i am going to be a nerd about it. i just think this was so relatable in a way that every person could probably agree to this line of thought - have you ever thought if there was another universe out there? if so, how do you think you exist in that universe? do you think you are better in that universe? make better choices, donate more, laugh a little louder, smile more often and are overall, everything you want to be right now? it's so comforting to think maybe in another universe, things are aligned enough for you to be the best self you can be and you can blame the state of your current universe for things not working out for you. it's such an easy way out to blame external factors for life not being easy (and i know genuinely there are external factors which prevent us from all of it) but sometimes, we are all that we can be. it's funny, biting, sad and beautiful in the most bojack-y possible - this is the perfect introduction to the show, if you like this, you'll like the show and it was such a beautiful read, oh god. i specifically loved the idea that the anti-yoni was the anti-thesis of everything yoni was and hence, he was good at hoops but eventually we learn, yoni is good at basketball, he just never gave it or himself a shot, convincing himself he's really not all that good which is just to say the potential lies with us (this is so optimistic, what happend to me? i am a cynic)<br/><br/>my favorites (by which i mean they feel like a specific callout to me) - <br/><blockquote><i><br/>Or, worst of all, what if the world on the other side of the door was no better or worse than our own, just different? What if it was just as heavy with war and famine and iniquity and cowardice?<br/><br/>I don’t know what would be sadder: that I would now be a third as happy as I was before, or the realization that what I was before—that is to say, what I am now—is three-quarters as happy as I could possibly get.What if I was zero percent happy, and I walked through the door to find that a hundred percent happy still isn’t all that happy?<br/><br/>but I am only as good as I am, and I could only do what the person as good as I am could do.<br/><br/>I often wonder if we aren’t likewise shaped by the qualities we lack, outlined by the empty space where the marble used to be. I’ll be sitting on a train. I’ll be lying awake in bed. I’ll be watching a movie; I’ll be laughing.And then, all of a sudden, I’ll be struck by the paralyzing truth: It’s not what we do that makes us who we are. It’s what we don’t do that defines us.<br/><br/>And I imagined that if I were in some other, better universe, there’d be someone who could tell me, It’s okay, or You’ll get ’em next time, tiger. Someone would tell me that all the stupid things I’d done, all my mistakes, they didn’t matter.This someone would say that, no matter what, she was proud of me, that I filled her heart with warmth, and that that’s really the most you could hope for in life—to just for an instant make somebody else just a little bit happier.She would tell me that—guess what!—everything was going to be all right.<br/></i></blockquote>",

        "My Review": "Books with a villain/anti-hero MC are typically a hit-or-miss for me. When done well, it can be so satisfying but when done poorly, it will remind of this book. The concept was such a win - ever since watching Black Swan, every ballet book just has instant intrigue from me.<br/><br/>What did not work for me unfortunately was the prose - I like beautiful writing, don't get me wrong but when the beautiful writing is used as a prop to encapsulate the lack of concept, I don't enjoy it. We did have a concept of Acheron and Lethe but the background context to it just wasn't good enough - at no single point did I feel like I had an understanding of what the author intended because we started with this foreboding sense of the monster slowly taking over Laure and how she was almost afraid of what she would become and by the end of it, the monster is almost shown to be a sympathetic character and I feel like I missed the progression which would explain such a contrast in viewpoints. <br/><br/>The love plotline was so stilted and weird and felt very out of place like it was immensely jarring to finish a chapter with gore and violence and suddenly, they're kissing? Like what? The murder plotline is something that is started to drive the plot forward but almost immediately abandoned with no real findings from Laure but just hypotheticals strewn in here and there and the answer to this plotline is too conveniently just thrown in her lap as opposed to be something she looks for. <br/><br/>Just no.",

        "My Review": "I once thought I knew the Mahabharat. In many ways, this book proved me wrong. <br/><br/>The book follows a river-like flow wherein initially it started off slow and confusing but like the story it tells, it crescendos into a high and creates an engaging narrative with themes many readers would be forced to think about.<br/><br/>This book forced me to think about my own position on the actions these characters took - Vaishnavi says it best when she says no one who was a part of Mahabharat was without faults and did misdeeds, it matters ultimately what the weight of those choices are. If you didn’t do what you had to do in those circumstances, what would have happened? Would that path be better than the one you are forced to take? <br/><br/>Every character was so profoundly complex - often times, I boil down this great epic that every Indian kid knows to the ‘good’ side Pandavs and the ‘bad’ side Kauravs but this book (and ultimately the Mahabharat) has provided so much background to these characters- are the good ones really good when they are presented with choices of gamble, misbehaviour, forgoing the rules of combat and acting as if they are beyond reproach? are the bad ones really so bad when you see instances of their humanity, empathy, bonds they’ve created, friendship and loyalty? ultimately you choose to abide by your belief of righteousness and you will always have people who don’t agree with you and what you do in these moments define you. The text was so deeply engaging in terms of dharma and adharma, conversations several characters have showed the multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>The exploration of bounding yourself to a belief, unwilling to change in the face of injustice to stand by your belief and how ultimately selfless intentions don’t always result in selfless actions was so beautiful and honestly, i know a retelling has done a good job when it makes me want to reread the original, Vaishnavi’s beautiful writing is always a plus (there are so many quotes i loved)",

        "My Review": "3.5<br/><br/>The Girls I’ve Been takes up a concept I’ve never read before and turns into truly something worth listening 9h of audiobook of. It takes concepts of a bank heist and turns into something truly phenomenal because who could’ve guessed that the opportune day the robbers choose to rob the bank, there’s a con artist and an arsonist in the mix?<br/><br/>One of my gripes with media has always been showcasing fairly traumatic situations and characters bouncing back from it like it was nothing, however, here we toggle between the present and the past, a lot of which is traumatic and due justice is given to the characters in acknowledging the shitty situations they found themselves in and the effect it had on them and their lives. The plot is well-structured with little to no lulls/filler content in between which makes for an exciting read giving the story layers of complexity.<br/><br/>Where the book misses the mark, for me personally, is marking it as ‘Young Adult’ and having the characters be teenagers when the voice/tone of the story/characters felt very adult and it would’ve been more cohesive for them to be 21-23. The only reason I feel it was YA is purely for marketing reasons since YA is a lot more sellable than Adult. Similarly, shelving it as ‘Thriller’ does the book no favors because the stakes never felt high, it always felt like it was inching to a resolution that was a happy ending for the main cast and at no point, was I worried about the heist ending poorly for the trio.",

        "My Review": "4.5 rounded up.<br/><br/>Prior to The Love and Lies, I've never had a book I so fiercely related to. Rukhsana Ali was more than a character from a fictitious novel to me. She was an amalgamation of my friends over the years. Her struggle with feeling at odds with her family, workarounds to revealing clothing and leading a double life is a life a variety of my own friends lead. Women in South Asia are usually born into a role which is expected of them. However, with that being said, as we progress, it's easy to see how young South Asian women struggle to fit themselves into a single box feeling duplicitous as they behave a certain way at home and a certain way when away from the eyes of their community. It would be unfair to strip away one part of us and say we are one half of the double life we surround ourselves with. (To be fair, this might only ring true for some and that too is okay). Her friends found it hard to understand why she wouldn't just give up her family and walk away in face of everything they'd done to her where it became clear just how big the cultural divide was. The author gives us a glimpse into the Ali's daily life, coupled with days at the store, unannounced dinners with gossip-y aunties and full-fledged get togethers with the Bengali community of Seattle to build a sense of the circle Rukhsana grew up in and the attachment she's formed with her own identity as a Bengali Muslim over the course of several years.<br/><br/>What Rukhsana is subjected to as a queer person raised in a conservative household is the worst case scenario possible and somehow, the most realistic scenario possible. It pains me when I think about the horrors Rukhsana suffered through are not an exception but the reality of most LGBTQ+ people in Bangladesh. In the pages describing her agony, I felt panic, anger and desperation all at once, having to remind myself that this particular instance of hate crime inflicted by their own loved ones was only a work of fiction. <br/><br/>The writing fell flat when it came to Ariana and Rukhsana's relationship - a couple we were supposed to root for due to how much was at stake for them. Or maybe just Rukshana. In a book where everything goes to shit, you'd hope there would always be a silver lining. The silver lining here was Rukshana's support system comprised of Aamir, Irfan, Sara, Nani and Shaila. Sadly, Ariana and Rukshana's relationship, to me, was underdeveloped and just not that great. From the very beginning, we are aware of the main conflict threatening to burst through the seams of their relationship - Rukhsana was not ready to come out to her parents yet. She feared the consequences of this particular action, knowing fully well being gay in a Bengali family could very result you in being kicked out, disowned or locked inside the house forever. Rukhsana had secured a scholarship to Caltech, her dream school and was consequently worried that coming out before she graduated high school might mean her parents might no longer send her away to Caltech. In the face of this, she faced pressure from Ariana to come out, which should never be the case. If you're entering into a relationship with a queer person, you don't get to dictate when your partner comes out. Additionally, while we are told a lot about their love several times in the way of how they fight and make up immediately after, there's nothing to show for that love, making their romance a hard one to root for and Ariana, a character even harder to like.<br/><br/>When I talk about Rukhsana's support system, I truly can't appreciate the ones who saw her and loved her as she is in simple words. When I imagine Rukhsana's position, I can't begin to express the feeling of isolation which must have plagued her, knowing she's got all these people around her but none can truly understand what she goes through, however, her hope was maintained by her loved ones. Just as how blindly her parents were ignoring Rukhsana's pleas, she is backed by people who are ready to stand for her at every turn, even going as far as to help her escape. My favourite form of her happiness came in her familial bonds - her brother, who supported her throughout it all and was ready to risk his own relationship with his parents to stand by Rukhsana, her cousin, who helped Rukhsana navigate her way through Bangaldesh to form her own escape and gave steady advice and her Nani who was a well of wisdom and support for Rukhsana. Their relationship was so pure with the Nani guiding Rukshana at every step with words of strength and guidance, urging her to fight for a life of her own making and carve her own destiny. Her acceptance of Rukhsana shines a light on how bigotry and homophobia is not a generational issue but an issue with people refusing to bend their beliefs in the face of humanity.<br/><br/><b> spoilers in next para </b><br/>While reading through reviews, I found many that lamented about <spoiler> Sohail's death </spoiler> being unrealistic. I want to cry and hold onto the hope that such a death could only be found in the pages of a novel and not out on the streets of Bangladesh. As someone who's been privy to the countless strikes activists take upon in Bangladesh, I know how it was like to hear that my friends were going to a protest and to hope that they'd come back alive, safe and sound. I wish this plot point was unrealistic but it's a reality that plagues the lives of those in the LGBT community of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>One of my biggest irks with the novel was her friends. To her credit, the author managed to display the privilege and entitlement that comes with being white which neither Rukhsana nor her parents can afford. From the very beginning, her friends downplayed Rukhsana's fears of her curfew or not being allowed to go the party at all, urging her to let it be because \"surely it can't be that bad\". This was frustrating on so many levels because later on, Rukhsana comments on how she's had to deal with initial qualms from her friend's family as \"someone who won't blow them up\" and Rukhsana, as a Muslim WOC, is just expected to understand and go along with this. She's expected to have intrinsic understanding of the fear people have of Muslims (internalised Islamophobia) and she's, more or less, supposed to be okay with her friend's parents thinking of her in this way. In a sharp contrast, we have her friends who fail to understand Rukhsana's culture and they don't try, to begin with. There's never a question of \"Why do you have so many rules?\" at any point in the novel. Somehow, her friends think that their own interpretation of the situation is correct and deem Rukhsana's to be incorrect or at the very best, dramatised. At no junction do they try to understand what she goes through or why she can't just come out to her parents. They have no idea why it may be life-threatening, as it is in several cases for South Asians, and dismiss it as \"Oh they'll just ground you\". At the end of it, overcome with guilt she shouldn't have, Rukshana is the one to initiate a conversation about her culture, feeling as though it were somehow her fault that her friends misunderstood her. Rukhsana's parents apologize to Ariana for their behaviour with her upon encountering the two of them kissing however, at no point does Ariana's mother come forward to apologize to Rukhsana for the harmful beliefs she held at the beginning. <br/><br/>Sabina Khan's novel, while very much about Rukshana, is also a love letter to Bengali culture and traditions. While I haven't been to Bangladesh in over two years now, the writing transported me right back to the busy roads of Dhaka feeling as though you'll never reach your destination in the throes of traffic. The dawaats, grand outfits and flashy malls filled me with joy because this is the part of my childhood that I resonate with. <br/><br/>The book end on a hopeful note with Rukhsana navigating her trauma and life while the community around her seems to be evolving to understand more about the sexual identity. The ending was crafted deliciously with light moments fleeting by while the family comes to terms with the past few months and opens up to each other.",

        "My Review": "I feel like this is the work that I’ve been so confident is the book that deserves three star like this is a three star book. I loved the set up and the plot behind this book, however, would that being said the problem with this book is that it was always building up to something, but I feel like it never quite reached that. in part, the description does the book dirty because the description mentions the great grandson learning about Meher but we never quite see that happen in the book. <br/><br/>The dual POV does not do the story justice because there are so disconnected that it feels like you’re reading two completely different narratives with no parallels between them - in part. it happened because the author wanted to touch on a lot of different themes, but they were not really connected such as the patriarchy, oppression of women, the partition and racism faced by Indians abroad. <br/><br/>In addition to that, the great grandson’s narrative was just not interesting like it had nothing going for it except for a lot of exposition that ultimately led to no payoff - I like this book because it was a quick read and ma’s POV was incredibly interesting, specially in the glances where we get to see her home life and her married life, and getting used to a whole new way after living, a life of freedom. What me about the story however, is that we get no payoff again for what may end of being and what her story sums up to.",

        "My Review": "this is such a unique way to write mysteries in a genre that is 100% oversaturated with tropes - i love the meta nature of the book and the thought process that goes behind writing fiction. because of the nature of this book, the author is able to lean into the absurdity of the situation and fully embrace it, including jumping on a running train and the person you thought originally dead coming back to kill you - sounds like a bollywood movie<br/><br/>my only gripe with this is that the setup which lasted about 30% of the way took too long and was incredibly descriptive making it incredibly boring but once the deaths started happening, it got way way more enjoyable ",

        "My Review": "You know the feeling when the book you're reading engulfs you in a warm hug,makes you a part of its world and every character feels like an old friend you know? This was that book for me.<br/>\"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder\" felt like home.With the old town setting & the sneaking around Pippa did, I was bombarded with memories of being a young kid and reading Famous Five/Nancy Drew.  <br/><br/>Initially,I felt myself grumbling about the details given to the monotony of her life after every production log but as I read,I came to really appreciate the focus given to building Pippa's life beyond just the mystery. I've come to expect every character to have a life so intricate and complex because of the books I've read aimed as dark mystery however, this was an eye-opener to the fact that most young adults (such as myself) have had sheltered lives that revolve around books,universities and perhaps the occasional murder-mystery EPQ.<br/><br/>I loved the breakdown of this perfect little town into a town clouded with well-kept secrets lurking under the surface . Most characters,for me,were in the grey zone hanging between the right and the wrong due to their actions,motives and ultimately,the chain reaction that their actions started off.<br/><br/>The use of mixed media made the book highly interactive and I found myself constantly connecting different suspects for the likelihood of our <spoiler>double murder duo </spoiler><br/><br/>If I had to pick,I'd take the speech Pippa gives in the very last chapter as the perfect end to a tumultuous ride.It highlighted so many things - not only about the victim but also of those involved - in the sense that most cases shell out everyone as one-dimensional but there are so many layers to each of them and I am happy that it was explored bit-by-bit as it was in this book and not all at once. The revelation bought on by all the pieces clicking at the very end was the cherry.<br/>To be honest,I've just finished the book and I expect to write a better review but as of now,my heart is just so full that I finally read a book that got me clapping and screaming at my screen. <br/>P.S - I just saw it's set to be a series so now I know what is going to be my next buy.",

        "My Review": "my favorite thing about this book was just how quiet this was, and I don’t think it’s entirely easy to explain what I mean by quiet, like yes, it was low stakes, but that is not what I mean. What I do mean is that I just enjoyed the found family for our main character Mia - I enjoyed how everyone had very fleshed out characters and ultimately i just like how mundane and unique this concept was. You don’t often see a space opera with the world so complex but at the same time, the focus is on the characters. We learn about the world in bits and pieces but the characters never lose focus in any of this. You don’t get a big adventure where all of them are of fighting a big big war, but you do get see them doing day-to-day tasks. My favorite thing was just the interactions that the characters had it felt so organic and genuine but most importantly, it just felt like these people were friends because they just liked each other and each other’s companies and I just enjoyed that. Obviously, this review would be incomplete without me, mentioning the art which was simply gorgeous. There were so many panels that were actually breathtaking that I had to stop for a minute and just soak it in. This was one of my favorite experiences ever in terms of reading a graphic novel, and to think I was about to DNF it.",

        "My Review": "I feel very comfortable in knowing that every single time I pick up a fredrik backman book, i can expect the unparalleled feeling of coming home because that is what his books feel like to me. They’re the perfect mix of hope, grief and love all coagulated in this absurdity that we call life - my favourite thing about this entire experience is just leaving each of these characters feeling like i know them and I truly do - which is why even as I read, I got excited about the infinite rereads to come.",

        "My Review": "fun quick read that clearly didn’t take itself too seriously and leaned into the madness - i really enjoyed the concept of each game; it was all truly so fucked up and the ending was just perfect<br/><br/><br/>i love the satire but the very real commentary of how minorities are often told to just work hard and keep their head down & not let themselves be noticed or how people use minorities as a way to inflate their own image, wanting to be the knight in shining armor rescuing them from their own poverty and coming out as a hero - the rich here took a perverse joy in adina’s struggles really enjoyed quite literally playing the women as pawn and the ending they got was so deserved - ive often complained that most books cop out with the villains, not giving them a satisfying end to be realistic but this is the one complaint i cannot have with this book because it smashed that out of the park<br/><br/>very reminiscent of the family games for me!",

        "My Review": "I can recognise the importance this book holds talking about sensitive topics while being incredibly respectful but at the same time, I don’t believe this book was for me - this was a quiet contemplative character study that unfolds over the course of many years giving us the perspective of each character to really hone in on what honor can mean to an individual, a family and a community rehashing the situations from each angle/character involved in the situation. while some of the chapters and characters were incredibly endearing and fun to read about, it felt like a drag to me because the plot wasn’t really there - it just all hinged very loosely on the word honor unfolding over a very slow book",

        "My Review": "The premise sounded like something I could expect Tiktok POVs to have but to my pleasant surprise, Nikki Erlick used this premise to offer an empathetic look at how as situation like this upends the world on a global scale and more importantly, on an individual. <br/><br/>In the days since I've read this book, I have become an absolute menace to everyone positing 'what-if' questions about their strings and the people who'd live to face the consequences. The Measure provides a very humane look on people, love and relationships - it doesn't just hinge on 'short-stringers' but the people around them. The characters struggle to accept that their/their loved-ones' lives may end so soon - the dual approach that many people take is also interesting; people either leave their jobs, move away and travel to live their remaining years with no regret or they struggle to cope with the knowledge of a short life, their regrets mount and they use their short time to exact revenge on others or cause accidents on a wide scale. That's on an individual level but as for global, the story repeats as it has in the history of the world - as much as humans are united against the face of adversary, our textbooks prove that time and time again, humans find comfort in discrimination - in othering others to protect themselves - this reassures us that we are safe & inadvertently, better. While the commentary was a little on the nose, this book offered a fresh look at the discrimination that plagues our 'now', short-stringers used to forward political interests, fear-mongering of an experience the long-stringers don't understand, reduced opportunities (jobs, bank loans, promotions etc) - all speak of a world we are familiar with today.  The face of discrimination has changed, yes, but the discrimination remains there nonetheless.<br/><br/>While essentially general fiction guised as speculative sci-fi, it poised a lot of good questions -<br/>Would I open my box? If I knew I had little time left, would I continue living the way I was? Would I date a short-stringer? Marry them? Have children with them? Would I fake my results to ensure I am not discriminated against? <br/><br/>I would love to say I have all the answers but I don't.",

        "My Review": "nothing i love more than the girlboss and the supportive malewife dynamic. you will always have my heart, alice sun and henry li, but especially, ann liang, for solving the conflict in this book in a way that centers alice and her own wits with henrys support, as opposed to making her seem desperate and having to beg to stay or need to be rescued. <br/><br/>\"this feels both quieter and bigger than that, as simple as coming home and as dizzying and all-encompassing as the wind rushing in around us. It feels like a thousand banished and buried moments have been building up to this—to us alone and untethered and weak with wanting—and maybe they have.\"<br/><br/>detailed review coming tomorrow when i am bored at work.",

        "My Review": "until you've experienced the nihilist deadland that is modern corporate life punctuated by passive aggressive smiley faces & no concept of work life boundaries, this book might not be for you. is it odd? very much so - your only frame of reference for the narrator and the characters is just their slack messages, something that isn't necessarily revealing of true personalities and you only know what they tell you. somewhere between a satire and a really smart sci-fi, this book will understandably make you laugh and if it doesn't, i am probably the oddity for laughing my heart out at 4am and depuffing my eyes at 6am to prepare myself for  work the following day. despite all of this, looking at my notes and highlights in front of me, i can also tell you this was a really smart book with observations that you wouldn't expect out of a book like this - case in point : <br/><br/> <i> By that logic, a relationship is just a cult with two people. Well, okay, two or more people. A shared language, shared rituals, devotion to ideals like “fidelity” or “love” or “getting really into Renaissance Faires together.” </i><br/>and <br/><i> you’re a few finger-flicks away from an unending stream of human rawness exported to posts and pixels but even if you’re not looking or if you can’t look (because staring at the sun for more than a few moments is bad for you) it’s still there, everyone’s still posting, still there to be beheld </i> <br/>and<br/><i>but if the only part of you that you can consciously experience is your consciousness’s experience and if all of that focus is 100% turned on to the dumbest fucking bullshit you’ve ever read in your life and that’s what you’re thinking about and since you’re all thoughts all the time that’s all that you are. </i><br/>and <br/><i>kind of like an extreme version of being on twitter or something<br/>looking into thousands of different people’s lives at once<br/>we’re not made to absorb this much human information at once, man. all the pathos and bathos and other thos-es<br/>I’d say it’s exhausting except I can’t feel tired and anyway it’s beyond that<br/>it’s overwhelming for a species that was basically content with an oral tradition of a handful of long-ass stories about the same six shitty gods for millennia </i><br/><br/>this book manages to capture the increasing need of staying connected in times likes ours where we're consuming more content each day than we probably did 15 years ago in a year and the sort of dread that comes with it- you have to stay connected but in doing so, what are you really gaining? you might log off but what happens if you miss the latest drama and how did you convince yourself you should care about the newest celebrity surgery pandemic? <br/><br/>it's also the perfect horror for the modern corporate employee (me) where the only people you can conceivably speak to is your employees because you're spending all your time at work and you've no other real connections beyond it so when your consciousness somehow does get uploaded onto slack, you're left badgering your coworkers to believe you because they're the only people you speak to but more importantly no one seems to find it odd that you're sending mails at 4am because you're being more productive than ever, you're a go-getter! a real team player a dependable employee so suddenly you're no longer being fired, your wfh is approved despite being a point of contention in the past and you realize you're just a cog in the machine.<br/><br/>also just point in case about how easy it is to become attached to people you've never met - i genuinely felt like i knew these people despite yknow not even knowing their true characters but just their work persona!",

The first 50% did a good job at building the tension over time, the oddness/creepy activities of Josie Fair kept increasing and Lisa Jewell had me on my toes waiting to see how would this turn out.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the 60% line, I understood the ending was not going to be what I was hoping for it to be - with Josie infiltrating more and more of Alix's house, it could only end in one way - Josie getting away with it.<br/><br/>At the 70% mark, I scrolled through the reviews eager to see how it ends - I came upon a terrible fact. In trying to setup a twist, Lisa Jewell absolves a pedophile and paints a 16 year old groomed woman as the \"real mastermind behind it all\" who orchestrated it all and made a poor 40 year old man fall for her - how could he have known?<br/><br/>No, thank you.",

        "My Review": "i don't want to be too presumptuous with my rating or when i say this is the best thriller i will read all year but i will do it anyways - for someone who has felt so disconnected with reading this entire year, i only put down this book when i was finished - a testament to the world riley was able to weave in just 350 pages. this is one of riley's best work in the past years, where he does what he does best - a nifty book with elements of mystery, thriller and horror all jam packed to form a tight story. do i think some reveals came out of nowhere? yes but did i have a lot of fun with this? also yes.<br/><br/>i was convinced i knew what was happening but for the book to veer in that direction before taking a complete 180° threw me in a loop - this is a book that'll keep you on your toes until the very last page.<br/><br/><br/>spoilers to follow (entire plot twist revealed for when I revisit my review) -<br/><spoiler> with my theories of carter being the murder dispelled, my heart was pinned on miss baker being virginia - i looked for clues in her blue eyes and how lenoras letters said their eyes were different. the berniece martin reveal left me gobsmacked - it turns out miss baker was a sister, just not the one i thought she was </spoiler>",

        "My Review": "<i> How often are we bright stars in someone else’s sky, but they couldn’t find us with a fucking telescope, huh?  </i><br/><br/>The Villa is full to the brim with an idyllic setting at a villa I'd sure love to visit, two best friends reunited but with conflicting feelings and a murder that takes place in the 70s at the peak of rock n roll. A revealing story about womanhood, how easy it is to get lost in someone else, choosing yourself and paving your own path. Oh, and murder, of course. Overflowing with reveals that especially picked up at the very end, The Villa is not what it seems at first glance - you have your fleetwood mac-esque typical 70s rockstars and their hanger ons partying in a summer when things go very very wrong. The women these rockstars string along to hang onto their every word pave their own way finding themselves at the front of a career post murder and become famous in their right but is there something darker lingering beneath the clear cut murder sentence? The villa they stayed in has been inhabited several times since then but most notably finds itself at the brink of another murder half a century later when childhood best friends make their way to the villa for six weeks. Did I tell you they are writers desperately trying to get their next book out? That should make for a fun read and it did!<br/><br/>Rachel Hawkins nails the story capturing the vibes of the 70s so beautifully and alternatively making each timeline interesting slowly building the suspense. My only critique, akin to what I felt at The Wife Upstairs, would be that the pace is always so off - the books start off so slow at a snail's pace that I feel like I am drudging along only to pick up at the very end but good thing she does unique plots justice",

        "My Review": "5 stars because not only did I finish it in one sitting but I am sitting wide awake at 4:30am marveling at this thriller.<br/><br/><br/>All The Dangerous Things follows all the typical makings of a thriller - an unreliable narrator, a stranger looking to solve the case, a mystery in her past and a fractured family in the present but Stacy Willingham does something truly marvelous with all these cliché elements - she creates a story so distinctly her own. It could be my own disillusionment speaking at the feeling of finally ripping through a book in one sitting but to be able to constantly keep the reader interested even when the twists are obvious is a feat all on its own. The pacing and structure of this book is incredible - all the twists come at the right spots, the reveals are clever and the foreshadowing brilliant. The book is fast, happening over the span of a few days, keeping me on my toes constantly and it gets right the one thing a lot of thrillers don't: flashbacks. The flashbacks in this book were sprinkled in throughout the narrative revealing the story little by little which was perfect. <br/><br/>The <i> then </i> part was giving me haunting of bly manor and that's all the push i can give you to read the book! The <now> does such an unexpected reveal on the biggest true crime cliché (100 points if you get it) - I had the killer pegged 1 hour in but the road to get there was so good, it was worth it.",

        "My Review": "<i>“There is a difference between living the suffering and reading about it.” </i><br/><br/>A Magic Steeped in Poison is exactly what you would need when you crave comforting tea and a high-stakes show in the background. Interlaced with the competition in a bid to be the court's resident shennong-shi, the overarching mystery of the traitor within the court and the political intrigue in the book, the stakes are incredibly high in this book making for a read that eventually turns unputdownable. What really sold this book for me is the seamless weaving of mythology and use of ancient chinese practices forming the foundation of the magic system in the book. It's very important for the magic systems in books to be no longer reductive and explore + push boundaries as far as they can - safe to say, <i> a magic steeped in poison </i> has a beautiful, vivid and unique take on magic. Tea as a way to connect, soothe and heal is a love language so special to the global south where the very first thing we do when a weary loved-one comes back or a guest is at our house is offer them tea. It's more than just a drink, it's a way to form connections with the other persons - conversations held over warm tea have the power to invigorate you. A warm cup when drank alone in a bout of homesickness is enough to return you to the feeling of home for a moment and offer you peace. I love that the book really respected not only the art of making tea, a magic all on its own balanced on the ingredients you choose, but also the medium tea provides you when consumed with someone else to be able to link you with them. <br/><br/>The political intrigue was incredibly well done especially with Ning at the forefront of it all, dealing with two-faced individuals at every turn and not knowing who to trust beyond the barest of few who fell under the working class. The critique of capitalism and the concept of the 'rich frolicking by while the working class toils for them with no reprieve from taxes' was integrated very well and you can feel the sort of burden the blue-collared individuals live in this book. Ning was an a pleasure to read about; not only did she have the conviction to make the reader root her but she constantly made decisions that seemed to have an uniform line of thought. She was very strong in the face of danger but more importantly she was someone who was very skilled in her art and that made her just all the more interesting. Her loyalties were unwavering and I loved the way she defaulted to spending time in the kitchen feeling more at home there where everything was the way it seemed. Her internal conflict is very well fleshed out and I cannot wait to read about how she overcomes it in the coming book, forgiving herself for her past mistakes and moving forward with the knowledge she has now that she didn't then. Her relationship with Kang is still new - I am equal parts delighted and frustrated that Kang didn't have his own narrative focus beyond his time with Ning where we learn about his past because I like him and I want to read about him! But I get the choice the author made in choosing to keep us in the dark like Ning is, making their relationship believe because if I am enamored, I understand why she is!<br/><br/>ALSO NEED TO MENTION THE SAPPHIC PRINCESS X HANDMAIDEN? I need more.<br/><br/><br/>My main critiques are mainly the pacing which seemed to pick up at the end with a lot condensed into very little when that spread of plot over pages could have been more even. The descriptions were also very flowery and while exorbitant in nature, I couldn't imagine a lot of the places detailed, after which I began to skip them because the prose was not adding up with the vibe established like I cannot bring myself to care about the way the garden looks when someone is about to die.<br/><br/>",

        "My Review": "<i> i know him, and in knowing him i love him, and in loving him i cannot do as he wishes </i><br/><br/>It is simply unfair that Alix has the power to say so much in so little because little did I know while going into a seemingly short story that it would play with my emotions so much. The Six Deaths of the Saint is beautifully tender in its portrayal of love and belonging - the writing is incredibly lyrical and only adds to the narrative prowess of the story. I did not expect that the story would as complex as it was with several twists taking me completely by surprise and the main character was stripped layer by layer revealing a little bit more about herself each time around. <br/><br/>Alix speaks of the desire to belong, to be somebody who's needed when they've spent their lives discarded, the price of power and blind devotion and how that can drive you to change your perception in your fierce need to be desired. A story about walls of delusion we build to lull us into a sense of safety and the blind eye we turn to maintain the reality we never had chasing the conditional love - how that often turns into a well of its own leaving us there entrapped in a place of our making and how connection with care for us and love us for who we are has the power to change all of that. And for all of this to be written by an author who so obviously cares about her characters and the way she tells her story makes for an incredibly reading experience.<br/><br/>Okay, I need to reread all my favorite scenes all over again",

        "My Review": "<b> Read as part of BooksandLala Literally Dead Book Club </b> <br/><br/>House of Hunger was a book that really found its footing story-wise around 20% in which is the point I would say, I was completely invested in it and started having a lot of fun. Having read Year of the Witching and now House of Hunger, I can safely say Alexis Henderson will become a go-to for gothic historical fiction because I believe she is able to describe the surroundings so vividly and the central conflicts of her books are always interesting. House of Hunger is a gothic tale set in 1800s where rich nobles of the North often take up bloodmaids, usually from the poorer regions surrounding them including the South, where we follow a young girl, Marion, looking to escape her life of servitude and financial instability with the prospect of being a bloodmaid for Countess Lisavet for the House of Hunger where she makes new companions in the residing bloodmaids. Her fairytale life is ruined by the seemingly shady practices she notices that goes on at the House. <br/><br/>Marion was a very interesting character to me - not all her choices were smart but they made sense in the context of her situation where she lets herself be so enamored by Lisavet and turns a blind eye to the obvious for a while because you can tell, she wants to believe so badly that she can have this seemingly perfect life. I loved the clues Alexis has peppered in throughout the book about the main \"mystery\" and finding the threads to correlate them was so much fun as a reader. <br/><br/><spoiler> real talk the death of the house mother was probably more satisfying than lisavet like the house mother had no reason to be acting the way she was and she got what was coming to her </spoiler><br/><br/>Where House of Hunger faltered is the pacing. The first 10-15% (although it felt much longer) focused entirely on Marion's life before and her journey to becoming a bloodmaid in extensive details which was honestly quite slow and my reading experience would have been better if this was wrapped in 2/3 chapters as opposed to dedicating a good screen time of the book to this part which, ultimately, does nothing outlining her character beyond her resilience and desperation in escaping her circumstances. The part focused on Marion's introduction to the House, the bloodmaids and the Countess was very well-done but we again encountered issues when it came to the conflict and the calm before the storm. Marion's period of bliss with Lisavet was covered in one chapter and while you're ultimately not meant to root for this borderline Stockholm Syndrome relationship, I would have liked to see some degree of chemistry between the two - there was no clear understanding of why Marion was attracted to Lisavet beyond her beauty and the inherent gratitude Marion feels towards Lisavet for being pivotal in her escaping the North.  My main problem is the conflict/climax which is a part of the blurb and makes up for very little of the book - it is made to look like such a big part of the plot with the whole 'bloodmaids start disappearing' when that is clearly to mislead the reader and not enough attention was paid to fleshing out the cracks in Marion's fairytale - it just feels like she stumbled into the mystery. I also wished Alexis would commit to the mystery - the 'Wretch' written everywhere was overlooked, the mushroom mentioned in Lisavet's back story felt like it had a potential to tie back in a satisfying full circle way <br/><br/>Overall, I vastly prefer House of Hunger to Year of the Witching - the themes of power dynamics, exploitation of the poor, hunger, girlhood, what it means to choose when the stakes are off balance and the house as entity which quite literally feeds on you were very enjoyable against a compelling backdrop.",

        "My Review": "this book is unassuming in its own brilliance in a way that it wouldn't be a complete understatement to say how much the blurb undersells the book - if i am being completely honest, i picked up the book because of the beautiful cover but the very first story was enough to hook me in. set in different parts of the US from Alaska to Pigeon Creek to Granville, each story holds center to itself a small town and characters linked to every other story in one way or another, in a way that's so beautiful and lyrical while still being completely accessible to anyone new to bonnie-sue's writing.<br/><br/>with pivotal themes centered around grief, memories, secrets and the mundanities of life, this book made for a very quiet heartwarming read, often reminding me of fredrick backman's style of observing characters and capturing their emotions. i loved how poppy was central to all of this despite her secondary role in the first story, something which i think is reflective of the whole book. stories of angry teenagers finding the empathy within in difficult situations and accepting a new family, of first loves and the way they're lost bringing everything else into perspective, of very popular girls with shaky histories and an ambition that outdoes the quiet seaside they come by and how it manifests in ugly ways, young queer love and accepting yourself when placed in a town that views you as wholly different, of catholic priests who get away with abuse for far too long and young children unable to express what happened with parents who don't listen close enough because the truth isn't clean-cut and young girls who find the strength within themselves to put an end to it all leaving fires in their wake, of a town quite like beartown and an obsession with a sport where you're never given a choice of if to play or not but you're always an outsider if you don't and questioning whether being good at something is the same as liking it, of friendships and a camp with children like no other, the eventual downfall of a man more trusted than entire departments, the wildfire that creeps into our lives blowing everything wide open and unexpected token of kindness by strangers often become becaons of hope.<br/><br/><br/>god, i loved this book. my favorites were probably the right kind of people and there's gas in the tank, louise!",

        "My Review": "i find it very difficult to articulate the experience of reading a backman book - sometimes i wonder whether the very fact that i have read such life changing books by him has forever biased me towards him and anything he writes or is he genuinely so good of an author that i will forever like everything he has to say in the way he says it? truth be told, the answer probably falls somewhere in between these two. i loved this novella very much with all my heart and yes, at points, i did ask myself if the concept is too simplistic for me to be in tears over it but the fact is backman captures life in a way that feels so authentic with so much heart, it's difficult not to like it. <br/><br/>interspersed with memories of his wife, his son and his grandson, this book paints a portrait of a very smart man with a few regrets up his sleeve and a lifetime of beautiful experiences, who is facing imminent death and slowly losing the one thing he holds precious : his memory. within 100 pages, we are introduced to 'Grandpa' and Noah, placed within a hospital room, his brain, his house and his boat, building a beautiful story of grief, loss, love and a life well-lived. you can feel the confusion and sadness grandpa feels at the gradual loss of his memories, the love built on a foundation of pure understanding and like-mindedness between grandpa and noah, a lifetime of regrets and trying to bridge it between grandpa and ted and most poignantly, the love shared between two individuals who've lived hundreds of experiences together for grandpa and his wife. <br/><br/>",

        "My Review": "3.5 <br/><br/>i am so sick and tired of authors building their story so lovingly with a main character you love and are invested in, sure, but more so, they build a hatred for a slew of characters/one character within the reader over the course of the book and the reader in all their assumptions edges closer towards the end hoping for a salvation to their hatred only for a mediocre ending and oh in case you forgot, the villain doesn't get the ending they deserve.<br/><br/><br/>i loved a lot of things about it, i did, which i will detail when i have time but let me talk about the negatives while it's still fresh in my mind :<br/><br/>i don't get why the witches were built to be evil, why did the finale have a big chunk of needing to defeat the witches - why couldn't they be morally grey but ultimately women who had been shunned to the forest, burnt at the pyre for \"sins\" that weren't upto them to begin with. i felt as if it were strongly implied that our fmc would find her safe space in these witches or their coven, learn their history and in turn their mom's and how the woods have become a safe for all those women who disappear into the forest after months of abuse at the hands of the men in a system that glorifies and encourages it. heck, i expected the woman running towards darkwoods during the blithe to be a statement of their liberation. the forest itself a metaphor for what they don't otherwise have. even when they said the forest doesn't take to the men well, i thought it rooted from the systemic injustic faced by women at the hands of men hence making the forest, a symbol and the body of the mother, untrusting of the witches as a whole. a lack of aligning reader expectations made this ~ twist ~ seem very out of left field.<br/><br/><br/>i don't get why immanuelle let the prophet go as if she hadn't murdered 4 witches just 5 pages ago, give them the same treatment?",

        "My Review": "becky chambers, i am in love with you and the world you've created. its so heartening to see a story of the exploration of human feelings told through the eyes of a monk traveling with a robot. the setting is so beautiful, truly a communist paradise and the explanation of pebs? im in awe. rhere were lots of plot lines specific to changing your body and how that doesn't change the essence of you and how you're still the same person even when your body changes which was beautiful. i also liked the subtle commentary on how people shy away from things they don't quite understand and retaliate aggressively to the same. a thinker ive left with is definitely the \"is having material comfort an essential or is living closer to the way the natural world occurs a bigger comfort?\"<br/><br/><br/>with that being said, what really got me were the lines of how coming home intrinsically means you're coming back to a version of yourself that no longer exists but is tied to this place and how that can always feel surreal, disorienting and nostalgic and on burnout even when doing things you love and how not taking enough time out for yourself results in burnout, also that it's okay to no longer love things you once liked to do! your value is not measured by what you give and you don't need to feel guilty for enjoying things without having working for it, definitely something i needed to hea<br/><br/>favorite quotes:<br/>“The  farmer  feeds  the  musician,  who brings  music  to  the  village.”  It  paused,  the  whirring  growing  louder.  “The technician who took a break to enjoy the music now has the energy to go fix the  communications  tower.  The  communications  tower  enables  the meteorologist  to  deliver  the  weather  report,  which  helps  the  farmer  grow more  apples.  I  see.”  The  robot  nodded.  “And  I’m  not  penalized  for  the  debt I incurred at the start?”<br/><br/><br/>“Nobody  should  be  barred  from  necessities  or  comforts  just  because they  don’t  have  the  right  number  next  to  their  name.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>They  just  …  don’t  understand  what  you  are. Or  maybe  they  can’t  fit  you  into  their  beliefs,  and  that  scares  them.  The unknown makes us stupid sometimes.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Paring  things  down  makes  the  small  comforts  all  the  sweeter.  You don’t  know  how  to  be  grateful  for  a  well-sealed  wall  if  you  haven’t  had  a winter  storm  bust  through  a  weak  one.  You  don’t  know  how  sweet strawberries  are  unless  you’ve  waited  six  months  for  them  to  fruit. Elsewhere,  they  have  all  these  little  luxuries,  but  they  don’t  understand  that food  and  shelter  and  company  are  all  you  really  need.  The  world  provides everything  else  without  our  meddling.”  They  smiled  at  Dex.  “What  do  you say to that, Sibling?” Dex  smiled  back.  “I’d  say  there’s  no  harm  in  any  sort  of  construct  so long as said construct has been proven to  do  no harm.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You  don’t  have  to  have  a  reason  to  be  tired.  You don’t  have  to  earn  rest  or  comfort.  You’re  allowed  to  just  be.  I  say  that wherever  I  go.”  They  threw  a  hand  toward  their  wagon,  its  wooden  sides emblazoned  with  the  summer  bear.  “It’s  painted  on  the  side  of  my  home! But  I  don’t  feel  like  it’s  true,  for  me.  I  feel  like  it’s  true  for  everyone  else but  not  me.  I  feel  like  I  have  to  do  more  than  that.  Like  I  have  a responsibility  to do more than that.” “Why?” Mosscap said. “Because  I’m  good  at  something,”  Dex  said.  “I’m  good  at  something that  helps  other  people.  I  worked  really  hard  to  be  able  to  do  it,  and  I benefited  from  the  labor  and  love  of  others  while  I  did  so.  I’m  able  to  do what  I  do  because  everybody  else  built  a  world  in  which  I  could  do  it.  If  I just  say  ‘Thanks  for  all  of  that,  but  I’m  running  off  to  the  woods  now,’  how is  that  fair?  That  doesn’t  sit  right  with  me,  not  at  all.  I’d  just  be  a  leech  if  I did that.”<br/><br/><br/>“You  are  the  weirdest,  most  inexplicable  thing  that’s  ever happened  to  me.  You  make  me  crazy,  most  days.  You  say  so  much  shit  I don’t  understand.”  Their  voice  cracked,  and  grew  almost  inaudibly  quiet. “But  whatever  it  is  we’re  doing,  it’s  the  first  thing  in  a  long  time  I’ve  been sure  about.”  They  swallowed.  “Most  days,  you’re  the  only  thing  that  makes sense.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>It  was  always  a  strange  thing,  coming  home.  Coming  home  meant  that  you had,  at  one  point,  left  it  and,  in  doing  so,  irreversibly  changed.  How  odd, then,  to  be  able  to  return  to  a  place  that  would  always  be  anchored  in  your notion  of  the  past.  How  could  this  place  still  be  there,  if  the  you  that  once lived there no longer existed? Yet  at  the  same  time,  in  complete  contradiction,  seeing  that  said  place had  changed  in  your  absence  was  nothing  if  not  surreal",

        "My Review": "this was so heartwarming!! i loved the story and the characters a lot more than the first book; loved the emphasis on home, belonging and making your own home so much. i loved that the part about the spirit was handled with no violence and it was so beautiful the way the spirit just wanted to share something they loved which holds true for the rest of the characters. this book is truly food as a love language which i adore, rinn and aedan were adorable geniunely truly loved the way they couldn't talk without blushing, their friendship is so vital to me and as always, erik and hesekiel content is appreciated, god they are so in love and i want that someday for me<br/><br/>i love the mountain chamomile dragon and the way they are described as wanting attention and wanting space but not knowing how to express either holds true for both my cat and i which makes me love them even more, especially with their grumpy expressions",

The story has nice roots, I do feel this particular book was setting up a lot of context for what's to come and I feel like it could've done with being longer because the changing seasons felt a little abrupt but all the characters we've been introduced to so far are very warm and kind which just helps with making this a very cozy read - i also enjoyed the queer side plot very very much it was beautiful and done so perfectly",

        "My Review": "<b>“Because everyone loves a girlboss until she tries to tell you what to do.”</b><br/><br/><br/>According to the title and the publisher, Eliza is supposed to come off as unlikable. Reviewers say she starts off as unlikable and I couldn’t disagree further. I’ve been in the same position as Eliza - feeling that your identity is so closely linked to a club, a club you work tirelessly for that you think everyone around you is going to work just as hard for it but when they don't, you don’t get it. You don’t understand they may not love it as much as you do. Her peers were annoyed that she was so sure that she was going to be the editor-in-chief. The media we’ve been exposed to has always had us pitting for the female MC who’s an underdog - she doesn’t know how beautiful she is, she just isn’t aware of her worth and so every once in a while, when we do get a MC who’s sure of herself and who knows her qualifications make her worthy for a position, it makes everyone uncomfortable. Even us as readers with all our wokeness encompassed by instances of people getting cancelled on twitter will still stop and say, “oh but she is unlikeable”. I politely disagree because I simply don’t see why it makes us uncomfortable to see someone who knows what she wants.<br/><br/> Why are we not uncomfortable at the fact that someone decided to run for the position on the very last day as if it was so inconsequential to them but they can get it? Why are we not questioning ourselves as to why a woman must be well-dressed for a speech but a man can just show up and that’s all it takes? She’s told that “you try too hard which makes you unapproachable, you know what I mean?” at which point, my girl, the icon, says -<br/><br/>“No”, I say, “No, I do not know what you mean.”<br/><br/>The book hit so close to home that most of my annotations are angry mumblings of “fuck you” and “how would you feel if i just kicked you out of the milky way?” - a topic that feels all too familiar can do that to you. The initial misgivings of all those that said she cried wolf and that she should stop looking for attention made me so angry at the students in the moment but when I look back, it’s so reflective of the world we live in today. The newer generation is suitably woke, aided by countless resources and even more “#YouAreOver” trends on twitter, but in all of this, I do think microaggressions get a slip by. Veiled under the guise of dark humor, jokes and misplaced anger as instant as ramen, sexist microaggressions are evident, no matter where you look. We’ve internalised the broader picture of sexism in comparison of which, “one class president being female amongst a constant trend of males in the last decade” seems shining and a step in the right direction. Eliza’s relationship with her appearance was very well-developed. We start off the book with her sticking to a baggy sweatshirt and not putting much effort into her looks and her sister’s overbearing self about the same can get quite annoying but over time, you see how Eliza grows from her own experience of being the new feminist icon and finds herself more comfortable in her own body to be able to try out these things. The experience of finding things to be very black-and-white wherein assuming putting on makeup makes you any less of a feminist and submitting to the patriarchy was very prevalent in the past decade, bringing with itself the “not like other girls trend” - an attempt to create more division in women based on looks and how it correlates to how smart/successful you are, something Eliza suffered from at the start and it was great to see her character growth,<br/><br/><br/>I loved the characters. There’s no question about that. My relationship with most of them was push-and-pull, the setting of Asian households feeling all too adjacent with my own upbringing (minus the internalised sexism, thank you mom). Beyond just Eliza, I really appreciated the depth bought to other characters like Len (my actual sweetheart bunny), Serena (my favorite trope over is mean girl assumed to be an airhead turns out to be an actual human with feelings and the main character bonds with them while feeling shitty about their assumptions) and Amanda (her conflicted feelings on participating in the rally at odds with the stereotypes of her own race and finding herself solitary in the way she felt was so well-done)<br/><br/>Len’s relationship with Eliza deserves its own paragraph. I don’t care, I make the rules of my review. They were adorable and I was positively gushing. Their first visit to the boba tea shop and him taking pictures of her was just cute - just give me wholesome couples is all I ask. This book has one of the tropes I adore which is, “MC reads books to talk about it/better understand their love interest” - it slaps every single time. Len was incredibly understanding and honestly, complemented Eliza so well. I was so happy with the route author chose to took and made Len a feminist icon instead of a sexist ex-jock who had to learn how to respect girls (gag) <br/><br/><br/>recommended for anyone who's looking for a fresh YA romance with feminist themes and lots of drama",

        "My Review": "this was a nice short read as part of my august read for the Literally Dead Book Club. i enjoyed the story, despite taking a little bit of getting into at first, but i feel like poe did a remarkable job in setting up the atmosphere of the story with his writing, which was only amplified by the gothic music i had playing in the background. i love love the idea of houses connected to residents and how the house is in itself an entity and the way one affects the other, which this story did so well.",

        "My Review": "this was good! i would love to read more memento-esque thrillers because the memory loss made the stakes so high and i liked how tight of a frame it happened in - i liked the police procedurals to an extent but the police part of it all felt like a character study on Halliday and John, more than it being about the case. The breaks they got were significant, sure, but I feel like the book would reach the end with or without them.<br/><br/><br/>what worked?<br/>the storytelling is great, you can feel the tension reverberating off the pages and i read this really quickly! all in all, a thriller which, true to its word, thrilled me<br/><br/><br/>what didn't work?<br/>i don't know if i am qualified to be a veteran of the genre but this felt fairly obvious and i knew the perpetrator before i knew the crime really. the author used lots of red herrings to misdirect the reader which is fine but those red herrings led nowhere and were so inconsequential to the story, it felt like a waste in some ways.",

        "My Review": "<b> 2.5 stars </b><br/><br/><br/>I am in Riley Sager's office, shaking him by the shoulders, asking him to be serious. I had such high hopes from Riley Sager, after having thoroughly enjoyed 3 of his past books only bypassing the 2021 thriller due to reviews that convinced me it was not for me, but this time, things were looking up. He had a Taylor Swift lyric in his epigraph and I was ready for tales of women scorned but obviously, given the rating, it disappointed. The first half was boring, maybe it's me but big chapters are such a turn-off, I was basically dredging my feet through it. Additionally, the drunk unreliable narrator trope is just no longer for me, I am not a fan of the common clichés employed within this trope such as 'everyone discredits the MC because they are drunk', 'MC questions their own memory and recollection of things because they are drunk', 'rain scene where MC is drunk', 'MC suspects everyone and pushes them away' like please please, put this trope to rest.<br/><br/><br/>*Spoilers Below*<br/><br/>The second part was even more exhausting than the first. The reveal of Katherine in Casey's house was great but it just went downhill from there, especially with how much suspension of disbelief it required. God, I was ready to settle for some half-assed story of Katherine and Eli having an affair hence leading Katherine to be aware of the whole Len arc and this being an eventual plot to frame Tom for some greater cause but no, Riley Sager, why? Why did you lean into the supernatural aspect of it all when you are a master at creating atmosphere? The atmosphere of House Across The Lake was nowhere spooky/creepy enough to warrant the use of this trope. I am so thoroughly disappointed, it feels like a copout and a bunch of tropes thrown together to form a story which is far less cohesive than any of his predecessors.",

        "My Review": "When asked about Perfect on Paper, I've pitched it as queer-centric Sex Education but with a lot more relationship advice carried out in complete secrecy. As someone going through a tough time, who latched onto attachment styles and intellcutalising everything to fit into boxes so things make more sense, this read came at a perfect time. Our main character identifies as bisexual, going through a tough time of her own - dealing with a crush on her best friend who doesn't seem to reciprocate - with another problem headed her way in the form of Brougham, a fellow student looking to fix his relationship with his ex-girlfriend in exchange for maintaining Darcy's secret of locker 89. The conversations revolving around queer teens, especially in the context of both sexuality and identity, were essential and were done with utmost respect and care, which I greatly enjoyed. The Queer Questioning Club felt like an actual integral part to Darcy's growth as a character, with a focus of its own, giving readers insight into problems queer teens may face at school and the author did a great job at making it a device important to both them and the story as opposed to having it feel like a throwaway, mentioned here and there, to move the plot forward. <br/><br/>Similarly, Darcy's responses to questions sent in by her peers were, not included at the start of most chapters, but referenced and used to further the plot in a way that felt meaningful. As someone, again, going through a tough time, in the context of the 'love/romance' department, this was actually super helpful. I am not too great at contexualising cues other people may give and it helps to see other characters, even fictional, deal with problems similiar to my own as a way to move forward, partly inspired by them. Additionally, yes, the one part where Darcy's sister calls her out for intellecualising everything to avoid feeling the emotions attached felt like a callout and I am thankful to the author because I needed to hear that, yep.  Also the 36 questions to feel closer to someone? As someone who's not great at conversations or moving it along, I again thank the author for introducing me to this gem.<br/><br/><br/>The banter between Brougham and Darcy was to die for, balanced equally with tender moments of vulnerability between the two. They got enough time together as they did apart, for it to still be Darcy's story as much as it was the story of her romance. I loved how the author integrated some very cute moments (cue: the rain scene followed by the movie) with moments where the characters opened up, let their guard down and just talked. As I grow older, I find myself wanting more and more of characters that just connect and this definitely served its purpose. <br/><br/>Also that one chapter on biphobia and feeling not 'queer enough' for dating someone of the opposite gender was just TOO real and i am really happy the author addressed biphobia, rampant both in and outside the community.<br/><br/>Sidenote because I am kinda tired of how much I've written but Brooke was just not it, idc.",

        "My Review": "<i> Our existence is made into a matter of opinion, as if our genders are debatable and not just who we are. </i><br/>bumping it upto a 5! <br/><br/>i really enjoyed this book, i picked it up on a whim eager to support more queer authors writing nonfiction, in a bid to educate myself further and a general curiosity on existence beyond the gender binary and i couldn't have picked up a better book.<br/><br/>the book is incredibly accessible in its contents and written in such layman terms, making it ideal for anyone at any age with varying levels of information regarding the topic at hand. despite having substantial information about nonbinary identities, i left the book feeling like i had learned a lot and with an overall new perspective on not only those that identify as nonbinary but also on myself and the way i function as part of the world. alok vaid menon writes about their experiences existing outside the binary as someone who was \"male passing\" and bought into question a lot of biases, that we all tend to do almost subconsciously - microaggresions towards those that may not necessarily perform in accordance to the social norms dictating how they should act and essentially bringing in the conclusion that gender is a performance, the norms we've associated with each gender are more so a reflection of the societal culture at the time, as opposed to something just \"intrinsic\" to someone conforming to a specific gender.<br/><br/><br/>i'll be linking a few of my favorite quotes here ☆<br/><br/>1. What I like about colors is that when you mix them together, they become greater than the sum of their parts, something different altogether. No one goes around asking, “But are you really more blue or more green?<br/><br/>2. Everyone thinks that since we “made a choice” to “look like that,” we are bringing it upon ourselves. The only reason people can fathom why we would look this way is because we want to draw attention to ourselves. They can’t even consider that maybe we look like this for ourselves, and not for other people. We are reduced to a spectacle. And when you are a spectacle, the harassment you experience becomes part of the show.<br/><br/>3. At a fundamental level, we are still having to argue for the very ability to exist.<br/>The truth is, I still cannot go outside without being afraid for my safety. There are few spaces where I do not experience harassment for the way I look. Something as simple as running errands leads to strangers interrogating me about my body, trying to find some way to explain why I look like this. “Are you dressed up for a theater production?” “Oh, it must be Fashion Week again!”<br/><br/>4. It’s a surreal experience to have your personhood be reduced to a prop.<br/>How are you supposed to be believed about the harm that you experience when people don’t even believe that you exist?<br/><br/>5.Gender non-conformity is seen as something immature, something we have to grow out of to become adults. Overnight, so many of the things that I loved not only became associated with femininity but with shame. Because I was a “boy,” I was no longer allowed to want to be a dancer or a fashion designer. Because I was a “boy,” I had to stop. Stop dancing. Stop being myself.<br/><br/>6.The thing about shame is that it eats at you until it fully consumes you. Then you cannot tell the difference between their shame and your own— between a body and an apology. It’s not just that you internalize the shame; rather, it becomes you. You no longer need the people at school telling you not to dress like that; you already do it to yourself. You no longer need your family telling you to be quiet; you already do it to yourself. You edit yourself, and at some point, it becomes so normal that you can’t even tell that you’re doing it. And the worst part is that you no longer have anyone else to blame.<br/><br/>7. Every aspect of myself was analyzed as either “masculine” or “feminine.” There was no in-between and nothing outside of these two options. “Why do you have so many friends who are girls?” “Why do you sit like that?” The idea here was that if you were a boy who displayed even a hint of femininity, then you were gay. And if you were gay, then you were wrong. And if you were wrong, that meant they had license to beat you up in the name of morality.<br/><br/>8. Truth be told, I don’t remember much of my childhood because I spent so much of it separated from my body. My body was where the shame lived, so I retreated into my mind. I was bullied everywhere, and it never stopped. It seemed so all consuming, like there was no escape. I became so terrified that my body would betray me—the hint of lavender in my voice, the sparkle in my gesture—so I sought comfort in my head, studying as hard as possible so I could one day get out of my town. I figured that if I was going to be effeminate, then I should at least be smart, to have something redeemable about me.<br/><br/>9. There’s magic in being seen by people who understand—it gives you permission to keep going. Self-expression sometimes requires other people. Becoming ourselves is a collective journey.<br/><br/>10. Society’s inability to place us in boxes makes them uncomfortable; the unfamiliar becomes a threat and not an opportunity. The unknown calls into question everything that we thought we knew about ourselves and the world.<br/><br/>11. The gender binary is set up for us to fail. For us all to fail.<br/>The gender binary is more concerned with gender norms than it is with us. We are led to believe that there are only two genders, “man” and “woman,” and these genders are narrow, separate, and opposite. We are taught from a very young age that this is how things have always been and this is the only way to live. We are taught that masculinity belongs to men, femininity belongs to women, and that these are the only two options for self-expression.<br/><br/>12. At its heart, discrimination against gender non-conforming people happens because of a system that rewards conformity and not creativity. Rather than celebrating people who express themselves on their own terms, we repress them. This repression is something we first did to ourselves. We know how to do it so well to other people because we were the first testing grounds. We silenced our own differences, subdued our creativity, and toned down our own gender non-conformity in order to fit in. We thought fitting in would give us security—but is it security when someone else living their life differently unsettles us to our very core?<br/><br/>13. Depending on whether we call them a boy or a girl, we assign each a narrative—we tell some children that they are strong, and we tell others that they are weak. We tell some children that they can express themselves, and we tell others that they should not have feelings. We tell some children that their worth comes from doing harm, and we tell others that their worth comes from accepting it.<br/><br/>14.They say that gender non-conforming people, in particular, are caught up on some new fad: that we are inventing language, identities, pronouns, and genders. But language and grammar have always been developed to meet the needs of society. Consider words like selfie and welp, which have recently been added to the dictionary. This is actually the purpose of language— to give meaning to concepts as they evolve.<br/><br/>15. Being normative is about what gets elevated by society to a position of power. Normativity looks like a specific sneaker brand being upheld as the best. Normativity, then, is about value judgment and shouldn’t be used interchangeably with normal.It’s not that gender non-conforming people aren’t normal, it’s that we aren’t considered normative. Gender diversity is a natural attribute of human expression, not an illness that needs to be fixed. Gender non-conforming people face considerable distress not because we have a disorder, but because of stigma and discrimination. There is nothing wrong with us, what is wrong is a world that punishes us for not being<br/><br/>16. Pain does not have to be visible to be real, and violence does not have to be physical to be serious. Imagine everyone you encounter all day long telling you that you are not real and that there is something fundamentally wrong with you. Being constantly invalidated takes a toll: 40 percent of trans and gender non-conforming people have attempted suicide. Emotional and physical violence are not in competition with each other. It is possible to acknowledge one without invalidating the other.<br/><br/>17. Gender is not what people look like to other people; it is what we know ourselves to be. No one else should be able to tell you who you are; that’s for you to decide. Rather than considering the existence of multiple genders as a bad thing or even a good thing, why do we need moral judgment of it altogether? There are many ways that people can exist and describe themselves. Why is that a problem? We don’t consider remembering everyone’s individual name a burden; we just accept that as the way things work. Gender should be the same way",

        "My Review": "3.5/5<br/><br/>To the book's credit, when I first started reading it, I was sure this would be a 4.5/5 and if that didn't tell you how much I was enjoying it; I don't know what will. Tokyo Ever After will forever have my heart for making me squeal at 4am and giving me the Japanese Princess Diaries I wanted. Yes, it's cliche and yes, it still executes them well. I really enjoyed the romance - there's just something about forbidden we-can't-be-together romances that hit different. Izumi's growth was so pleasant to read about and I am excited to follow the second book to see more conversations on the inherent patriarchy embedded in the imperial system dealings - also, highkey, I just want a book about Hanako x Makoto hashing over their Harvard romance to their reconciliation.  The scenes in Kyoto were definitely my favorite - written with so much love and reverence, I could feel the peace emanating through the pages.<br/><br/>Moving onto things I didn't like which, more or less, ruined things for me. The pacing was off. The first half of the book moves at a slow pace, setting the characters and background well. However, the second half presses down on the accelerator hard with things that one would think would take a bit more resolving getting thrown out of the window in a chapter (Think Izumi's kiss which, when being a onetime event, just quickly followed into a succession of more? I didn't feel connected to it because of how many times the stakes were reiterated over the course of the book). Similarly, for the last plot twist, I feel like the author just created things from thin air, regressing the development of an entire character to fit a narrative when no such inkling was given before. Had she hinted at it early on in the book, as sure-fire signs that would strike the readers as odd but one that would be dismissed by Izumi, the reveal would have been more satisfying instead of feeling like it was created at the last minute to resolve said conflict.

        "My Review": "<b><i> \"Like the way friendship can be just as intense, beautiful and endless as romance. Like the way there's love everywhere around me - there's love for my friends, there's love for my paintings, there's love for myself,\" </i> </b><br/><br/>Despite my rating, this is one of my favorites of the year already. Do I have problems with it? Yes, but I've simply chosen to focus on the aspects I love and there is so so much to love. To see parts of myself in a book, thoughts I've had penned down word for word, was so validating. Like Georgia, I have never had romantic experiences to speak of and have often felt like I was behind my peers for never been able to jump into conversations with my own tales of sexual endeavours. I just feel so much love for this book - it's crazy. I love their friend group and the experiences they go through, which was handled realistically. No one in this book is perfect and it would be unrealistic to expect the same off of them because honestly, when you're 18, you are stepping into the world on your own for the first time and you will not get everything right. You are going to say hurtful things you don't mean, do things you regret in the future and find yourselves in situations that make you crawl into a ditch and you won't handle everything with the eloquence expected of you and that's okay. It was so fucking realistic and somehow, Alice Oseman made the slang in the book just perfect without making it seem like she was out of touch - some texts in this book could have literally been genuine conversations my friends and I have had. Georgia is, perhaps, the first character I have seen myself in - including the anxiety for making friends and socialising, spending all your time reading fanfiction and just desperately wanting to hold on to the friends you make, so much so that conflict scares you. <br/><br/><br/>Posting all quotes I loved because why not - <br/>\"I couldn't admit to them how desperately I wanted to be in a romantic relationship. Because I knew it was pathetic. Trust me. I completely understood that women should want to be strong and independent and you don't need to find love to have a successful life. And the fact that I so desperately wanted a boyfriend - or a girlfriend, a partner, whoever, someone - was a sign that I was not strong, or independent, or self-sufficient, or happy alone. I was really quite lonely, and I wanted to be loved.\" <br/><br/>\"God I just wanted to make a friend\" <br/><br/>\"Friends are automatically classed as 'less important' than romantic partners. I'd never questioned that. It was just the way the world was. I guess I'd always felt that friendship just couldn't compete with what a partner offered, and that I'd never really experience real love until I found romance.<br/>But if that had been true, I probably wouldn't have felt like this.\"<br/><br/>“I used to dream of a spellbinding, endless, forever romance. A beautiful story of meeting a person who could change your whole world.<br/><br/>But now, I realised, friendship could be that too.”<br/><br/>\"I hadn’t realised.<br/>I hadn’t realised how behind I was. I’d spent so much time thinking that my one true love would just show up one day. I had been wrong. I had been so, so wrong. Everyone else was growing up, kissing, having sex, falling in love, and I was just …<br/>I was just a child.<br/>And if I carried on like this … would I be alone forever?\"",

        "My Review": "edit - 3.5 stars, rounded down. Goodreads, let us do half-star ratings, please?<br/><br/>I've just finished this book and the rating has gone through a tumultuous decline going from 5 stars to 3 stars because the more I dwell on it, the more problems I have with it narratively. Now I am fully aware of how most of the problems with Scarlet are just pet peeves of my own in fantasies but it is what it is. <br/><br/><b> 1. Character Development </b> - While Cinder served to be a good insight into Cinder's personality since her emotions were at the forefront of the book, I feel that by the end of it, I had a pretty good idea of who Cinder was and I was rooting for her. However, in Scarlet, I feel that you don't learn a LOT about Scarlet. The struggle to find her grandmother starts as a pivotal problem for her but that only holds for the first 10 chapters, after which we are treated to 20 chapters of Scar and Wolf's budding romance (with no indication of why they are attracted to each other beyond the fact that they are main characters). I came out of this book, feeling that Scarlet was only a caricature of a person and her main role was to depend on someone and have them be the reason for her entire emotional growth, be it her grandmother or Wolf lol <br/><br/><b> 2. Romance </b> - I find the romance cringy. Idk what to tell you but her trusting him immediately made no sense given the person we'd been shown so far (hence tying into the lack of Scar's character development since she goes against everything she stands for in the first 5 chapters itself). Wolf gives her reasons to not trust him again and again but she does just because?? Sorry but that was incredibly ungrounded and honestly, the conflict between them lasts for a day virtually, in the span of which he kisses her to help rescue her while she is evidently emotionally taxed but yay he's the hero, I guess?? and then the conflict is solved by 'he's not like the rest of them' - why? he just likes you and so he's not like the rest of them. stfu. For once, I wish they had an actual conversation about how his betrayal actually hurt her instead of letting bygones be bygones because yum big sexy dog <3 <br/><br/><b> 3. Just more complaints </b> -  This entire book was giving me ✨Wattpad Werewolf Romances✨ and I feel like a lot of phrases such as <i> This one is mine! </i> which only contributes to treating women as objects were used with the excuse of primal instincts and honestly was really underwhelming.<br/><br/><b> The Saving Graces </b> - Thorne, ofc. He was giving me Flynn Rider from Tangled the entire time and I feel his character is just the right mix of comedy relief and a person who comes through in difficult times. Iko - I love their personality so much and I just wanted more scenes of their interaction with Thorne. Cinder - she's very good with strategy and she was much smarter in this book, left to her own devices.",

        "My Review": "book rating - 4☆<br/>series rating (so far) - 3.5☆<br/><br/><b> what i like </b> -<br/>Tyson. He was so much fun to read about and he had a great arc so far. I am basically a sucker for big guys with big hearts.<br/><br/>Plot. I like how we're slowly drawing closer  to the battle that'll come in The Last Olympian. The twists in the last chapter were so so good - redemption arc for the whole book fr<br/><br/>Percy. As always, absolute golden boy. His development from being embarrassed for Tyson and invading Clarisse's quest to missing Tyson and putting himself in Clarrise's shoes. Best 13 year old ever.<br/><br/><br/><b> what i don't like </b> -<br/><br/>1.The growth of all the side characters - Since Percy is the main narrative voice in this novel a lot of it focuses on his emotions and how he feels about a particular situation which is great because a reader can feel for him and bond with him and be able to justify his actions, however in the same vein, you don't get the same sort of justification for any other character. For example  - I understand that Annabeth is sad but I don't feel the gravity of her emotions so I don't care about it all that much. A lot of it has to do with the fact that each book contains lots of adventures for a quest, making it harder to correctly display character intentions, important for growth, so when a character does something critical, it seems out of the blue.<br/><br/>2. How Greek mythologies are handled -  I love that this book was an avenue for kids who are fans of these mythologies to see the world represented in a way that it never had been before,however, this book also takes tropes of good and bad which I do not feel applied to the world of gods like poseidon is portrayed as a neutral character like he's good enough and most of his actions are justifiable in comparison to other. This book was also Hermes's redemption arc, and then people like Medusa Ares Circe who are portrayed as 'bad' gods. The Greek Gods are not as easily distinguishable as good and bad when most of them including Athena (who seems to be a favorite in the book) were in the grey and going ahead, I'd like that portrayed in the book, as percy's perception improves and matures with age. For example, the book is so biased towards Athena while Aphrodite is portrayed as shallow and it's just a very surface-level deep message to me, at least.",

        "My Review": "first reread - 1/2/22<br/><br/>this was my first time rereading percy jackson since i first got the book and let me just say, this has aged so well. the entire series is very comfort to me with characters that i love and adore so much but given the difference in my age, i was really able to appreciate the media as well - i like the representation of dyslexia and ADHD here - can't even begin to imagine how it must have been to see yourself in the main character of one of the most popular books of our generation. additionally, i loved percy so so much - i love the family dynamic he has with his mom, his wit that literally doesn't bow down to anyone, be it a suspicious math teacher or an immortal god or how he keeps on going despite everything that happens. also his mom!! ohmygod, his mom - it finally struck me how powerful and evocative the last chapters were, especially the one where his mom insisted taking control of her own life, as opposed to letting Poseidon or Percy fight her battles for her.",

        "My Review": "this is one of my favorite books i've read this year and the one i'll probably credit in the years to come for reigniting my love for sff. <br/><br/>Iron widow is pitched as a reimagining of the lives of Wu Zeitan - China's only female emperor - against the backdrop of a world terrorized by strange aliens causing the government to develop giant transformer-like ships controlled by a male and female pilots by use of their qi. oh and the female pilot almost always dies in such endeavors and tragedy strikes Zeitan's family when her older sister dies in one such incident. Vowing to kill the man responsible for the death of her sister, Zeitan finds herself with more than what she bargained for, becoming entrenched in the mysteries of the oppressive system the government fights hard to keep secret.<br/><br/>Zeitan is an incredible protagonist and reading from her POV definitely made the story more enjoyable - she isn't the hero but the morally grey antihero, willing to sacrifice everything it takes to satisfy her own endgoals (as she should - let's go, girlboss!). She wants to destroy everything that she finds in this highly patriarchal world where the odds are stacked against her. Zeitan's anger was so prominent through the pages that I had my own teeth gritted, mentally screaming, \"Kill them all\"<br/><br/> I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on the continued pain in her feet - owing to the bounding ritual which took place when she was 5 - and am in awe of Xiran combined practices like foot binding in the futuristic world of Huaxia. Their depictions were incredibly moving and had me feeling phantom pain in my own feet.<br/><br/>The plot was incredibly engaging - I would be lying if it didn't take me a little getting into at the very start because the whole mechanics of the world were revealed, one layer at a time but as soon as she kills the male pilot, the plot picks up and never staggers even once. I finished the book in such a hurried frenzy, as if I couldn't stand to not know what happens next and if that doesn't tell you how good the book was, I don't know what will.<br/><br/>The poly M/F/M couple was not something I was privy to, prior picking up the novel but it was a great surprise and I love them all so much with all my heart - I only want more Shimin and Yizhi scenes, against the background of Yizhi's upbringing since I don't think we divulged enough into that. Additionally, I am curious of the lives of the side characters and hope that the author divulges further into their lives in a series of tidbits since the side characters have managed to strike a lasting impression on me.<br/><br/><br/>I would be lying if I said this book was perfect - it had its flaws but they were flaws I was okay with and I truly love this book for making me love SFF all over again.

        "My Review": "This is a book one must reread with all the knowledge of the wars the Aristotle Mendoza holds inside him to appreciate it. For 70% of the book, I was reading it with no particular feelings bordering on either like or hate, however, the last 30% really made up for it. My biggest qualm about the book had been the lack of monologue from Aristotle about Dante which is why I was in constant disbelief of their friendship and consequently, love - however, the last half of the book serves to answer all of this and more. Aristotle is a beautiful character, carrying the ghost of his brother and his own conflicting feelings shrouded in loneliness inside him. His parents aren't without flaws - infact, they contribute to the person he is with how closed-off they've remained about Ari's brother, making it so as if he were dead leaving Ari to wonder who he was and why he haunts Ari's dreams. His father served the country during the Vietnam war, leaving him forever changed and he <i> can't </i> bring himself to talk about it and consequently, Ari has learnt to bottle things inside him allowing himself to feel anger at best, with no way to ask for help in the growing maze of puberty and his dreams. All of this changes when he meets Dante. Dante, who's so different from him and who has learnt to talk about his feelings. Dante who wears his heart on his sleeves. The book spans over the 2 summers prior to their senior as they grow up, finding companionship in each other amongst growing pains. They were adorable. I love them and I will be rereading if only to understand this book better. By the end of it, Ari's internal monologue was so much more fleshed out and complex, a hint of his own growth as he slowly learnt to come to terms with his feelings about everything . ",

        "My Review": "dnf at 25%<br/><br/>I was enjoying this book a lot, don't get me wrong, it had me laughing so much and the way the aunties behaved was all too relatable. It was genuinely exciting to read this portrayal of asian culture that was a mirror image of the real world and characters who were so fleshed out, in all their imperfectness. <br/><br/>my real problem with the book honestly is the constant mention of how <i> small and tiny </i> the mc is - it came up almost five to six times in the first 20% and honestly, after the 5th time, i was just irked off enough to not be able to enjoy the book anymore. just once, an asian mc can be asian without being tiny and small because the way i see it - these characteristics have been used to fetishize asian women for so so long and even within our culture, being tiny and small seems like such a given if you're asian that when you're not, it's a problem and it doesn't sit right with me because her being tiny played NO role in the story.",

        "My Review": "Rereading harry potter was akin to dipping back into a river of nostalgia. Having grown up with the books and character for a better part of my life, reading book #1 felt like watching the movie in my head. It was every bit as good as I remembered it to be but with some exceptions - I can't digest the 'Chosen Boy' trope which is the very foundation of this book but the 'Chosen Boy can do no wrong' is insulting and annoying to Harry Potter - he's given so many passes just because he's <i> Potter </i> despite arguably, the real hero being the parents whose love outpowered Voldemort's hate. Harry and Draco are quite similar in ways except Harry is celebrated for it and Draco is not. Had these book been a 1st POV, it would make sense to be so favorable to Harry but it settles on a biased omnipresent narrator with clear loyalties towards some houses (much like Dumbledore). Another instance is the fact that everyone who's supposed to be 'evil'/'bad' is described as ugly which is such a simplified version of good vs evil to feed to children - sorry for expecting MG to be cleverer and not forgiving it for teaching what it does to impressionable audiences. However, with all these been said, did I still tear up when reading the part where Dumbledore awards the four with points and they get showered with love? Of course, I did.",

        "My Review": "<b> This review alludes to situations which occur in the later half of the book and hence, may be spoiler-y</b><br/><br/>Andy Weir does it again. Reading Project Hail Mary was an incredibly transformative experience - when I picked it a few days back, I expected the genius I've come to expect when Weir is involved, of course but what I didn't expect was to be sobbing at the friendship formed by Grace and Rocky. For a book that was marketed as sci-fi, this book made me cry 3 times (when Grace says \"Well, you're not alone anymore, buddy\", when Grace goes back to save Rocky sacrificing his chance at life on Earth and when the book ended)  <br/><br/>In a truer sense of the word, PHM is a thriller, an intense one at that - keeping the reader on the edge of their seats as conflicts come up with entirely believable baselines and you find yourself holding your breath, in how this may end. The stakes are so high that it's hard not to get emotionally invested in the characters - particularly when the French climatologist cried at what had to be done to offset the rate of extinction caused by Astrophage.  The world I live in has not yet experienced a mass extinction event, leading my own life to be one of unprecedented comfort, so placing myself in a familiar setting only with the looming danger of extinction was hard but Weir does it brilliantly with the chaotic nature of how Stratt leads the operation, pulled back into reality with mentions of how the government have settled with the way Stratt run things but aren't happy about it or how corporations still fight over petty things seemingly small in the face of an apocalypse. <br/><br/>When DuBois and Shapiro die, Weir's red herring about their relationship plays brilliantly - leading the reader to believe that the explosion may have been caused because they were busy fraternizing - is that part of human error? Sure but it places the responsibility of that on two people in love. However, Weir's intended plotline shows human error on a grander scale where the unit accidentally hands a milligram of Astrophage as opposed to a nanogram. To the average human, differences in this scale is so miniscule that it would barely go unnoticed but it brings into perspective the weighty danger of playing with fire (literally) and the consequences of the same or how they trudge forward knowing the lives lost but with no time to grieve. <br/><br/>This book particularly hinges on friendship and how the universal experience of life and loneliness seems to be present in communities from microbes all the way to intelligent species. Rocky and Grace were my favorite duo ever written - they carry so much sadness, guilt and responsibility over their actions (or lack therof) and how it led them to Tau Ceti but the way they find each other and rely on each other for support and companionship literally broke my heart. Like, I am not joking, there exists a weird spider dude in the Weir-Universe who makes me sob and laugh and I love him so much. My face leaks when I think of him, it's a human thing, understand? <br/><br/>Grace's dry humor is so (in)appropriately placed. Yes, the world is dying and he may be the only one able to save it but he's still full of quips and retorts, often using humor as a coping mechanism in the situations he finds himself in and to avoid facing his own shortcomings. His character development is so amazing - he finds himself on a ship, suffering from retrograde amnesia with his memory coming back in bouts. He soon realizes what the ship's original mission was and sets about to complete it on his own, despite how originally he was too scared to go on the mission and give up his life. It's funny what the brain can convince you and how much you can push yourself once you convince yourself you can. The moment when the plot finally reveals his act of cowardice, it's a far cry from the hero we've come to see Grace as - the man who does EVAs in 1.5g or the man who learnt the Eridian language in a matter of few weeks or the man who gave his crew members the appropriate see-off even when it was hard - and that moment truly cements Grace as a human. An amazing scientist, a brilliant microbiologist with a flair for invention but ultimately, a human who can't fathom willingly dying. This is in stark contrast to the Grace we see in Ch-27 who rides off back to Tau Ceti to save Rocky, knowing fully well he's directly walking towards his death when he has a chance at survival.  Their reunion is just so sweet. I love them so much. I can't deal. <br/><br/>This is all I have for now. Will I update when I think of more? Probably.",

        "My Review": "For someone who has a bad track record with romances often ending up in dnfs, The Bromance Book Club was a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>TBBC follows Gavin Scott on the brink of a divorce with his wife, serving as the wakeup call to the state their relationship is in. While desperately wanting to save his marriage, he reluctantly agrees to the help offered by his best friend, Del in the form of an undercover book club. The purpose of the book club, you ask? Men, in need of fixing their relationship and willing to go through growth, read romance novels to understand women's perspectives. <br/><br/>This book was an absolute delight to read and left a sappy smile on my face at all times. The main cast of characters are so endearing, in particular, the book club members who were the ones keeping the com angle of a rom-com alive her. I loved the way Gavin and Thea's relationship was laid out with conflict that felt real and stakes which seemed to affect the characters in drastic ways.<br/><br/>I loved the depth given to side characters, making them seem like real people which was done effectively without taking anything away from the main story.<br/><br/>All in all, men fighting for their family and going through self growth to put in the emotional growth required in a relationship with the help of their friends who let him have honest conversations, call him out in his bullshit and don't laugh at his shortcomings? why, yes, of course, that's a superior trope.<br/>",

To my surprise and utter delight, it still holds up to this day and I had so much fun revisiting all these characters. Also, I picked up on the fact that Clementine has ADHD - something I didn't quite realize when I was younger but the portrayal is done so well and I love the entire cast of characters so much but especially Clementine and her parents. They warm my stone cold heart and I love them for it.",

        "My Review": "The year is 1955. Cyclists, street vendors and nimble-footed pedestrians bustle about the dusty roads of Jaipur. Amidst it all, huddled inside a tonga beside her faithful helper and a litany of tiffins, is thirty-year-old Lakshmi Shastri: the henna artist working for Jaipur’s elite complete with flashbacks detailing her failed marriage, her parents and the ayurvedic teachings of her mother-in-law. <br/>Lakshmi plays her role as the protagonist with grace, subverting expectations at every turn, navigating the landscapes of caste, class and patriarchal standards brimming under Jaipur’s luxurious pretences. On the other end of this spectrum is Radha, impatient, hard-headed and the kind of character one can’t help but roll their eyes at.Yet despite these traits, Radha shows moments of incredible strength and maturity, making it easy to forget that she is only a thirteen-year-old girl, and that like Lakshmi, she, too, has been a victim of society, circumstances, and the consequences of Lakshmi’s own actions from thirteen years ago.<br/><br/>In Alka Joshi’s debut novel, The Henna Artist, India is not just a country but an emotion embodied by the people who live there. At its core, this book is a tale of both individual and collective independence in a post-colonial India stuck between the richness of its culture and the allure of foreign trends. From distinguished ladies to battered servants, to hungry entrepreneurs like Lakshmi, this story is of women who dared to dream, to survive, and reach for a future beyond the bounds of their perceived station.  At times a coming-of-age story, at times family drama, much like Lakshmi’s designs, its intricacies are deftly wrapped within the folds of time, place, and a deceptively simple narrative. It is also a subtle critique of India’s ancient caste system and its intersections with latter-day capitalism; of cerebral and financial equality in a world where women cannot so much as walk the streets without a husband or chaperone in tow -- a thing that is, in many ways, not so far removed from present-day India.<br/><br/>Alka Joshi worked on The Henna Artist for a decade before it was picked up for publication. The heart and soul she put into this novel shows – a story of hope, ambition and healing.",

        "My Review": "I often struggle to properly explain why I love a book when I love it so much, which is why this first-thoughts review might not do the book justice. It was amazing - I am still reeling from the aftermath and it was so gothic, so atmospheric and just everything that a boarding school mystery should be with incessant nosy main character with a flair of sleuthing, the years of history that the dormitory held complete with shady alumnus and haunted girls. This was just so good and made for such a good reading experience and I can see myself reread this in the future hence the 5 stars.",

        "My Review": "To its credit, Local Woman Missing has a very strong start. Delilah's POV is endearing and gritty, almost immediately making the reader root for her, holding their breath with her as she slinks away from her kidnappers and feel pure joy when it seems as if she's bought to justice. Part Two begins with the stormy night that took Meredith and Delilah away from Josh - we follow Meredith's neighbor, Kate who serves to bring the reader up to speed of the incidents that occur immediately after Meredith's disappearance. In addition, we have Meredith's POV, set a few months prior to her own disappearance, detailing her day to day life slowly inching the reader forward to the events that lead to the tragedy. Finally, we have Leo (Delilah's brother) as the side to explain all the events taking place in the \"now\", i.e., right after Delilah is found.<br/><br/>Despite the final \"villain\" being, more or less, predictable, this book was a page-turner with so many little twists going on at every corner and I couldn't seem to put it down, the thrill of finding the final puzzle piece keeping me at the edge of my seat. Additionally, the book delves into the lack of consent and general disregard of the mother's health during birth and post, where suspicions are chalked up to Meredith for having pills at her home from the time she had post-partum depression or Shelby's needs are neglected during birth with forceful pelvical exams despite her expressing discomfort. This book discusses these issues at length and let me question a practice which I, otherwise, wouldn't have.<br/><br/>With that being said, the book had too many red-herrings - a tactic which when employed perfectly can serve to misdirect the reader cleverly - however, in this case, none of the falsehoods had any sort of resolution leaving us with too many questions and no concrete answers (was the man following Bea and Meredith the OB/GYN or Jason? Who was the real father?)<br/><br/>Another problem was when details would be first mentioned serving the reader its intended purpose but would then be detailed at extensive length in another chapter with no actual payoff since the reader is already aware of how the situation ends.  This particularly struck me when a midwife tells Kate and Bea about Shelby's birth, leading to a possible lawsuit against the OB/GYN, which is then detailed in a much later chapter but why should I read it when the fate of the baby is already known to me? Dueling timelines can be hard to pull off but particularly, aligning details in a way that is consequential and of importance to the average reader. The book also had a lot of fluff, which ties into the very first point, lots of points are included for the sake of including them but serve no purpose to the actual story other than leaving the reader to mull it over on their own. We get extensive details of Meredith's home-life and her practice as doula, despite not much of it affecting the main story. There is a plotline where Leo is bullied by someone at the sitter's home and I still don't understand how that contributed in any matter towards building a narrative. Consequently, there's a part where Kate and Bea decide to be amateur sleuths and investigate the OB/GYN themselves which has no payoff other than immediate shock value. <br/><br/>I still don't understand why we didn't get Delilah's POV since she was a character the readers were rooting for but apart from Part One, we only see Delilah through the eyes of her brother when it could have been a POV plunged in confusion and constant questions. This is not a problem as such but Mary Kubica can't write male POVs - Leo came off as super \"pick me\" nice guy constantly lamenting about how doesn't have a girlfriend, like do I care? In similar vein, the writing had lots of <br/>telling the reader exactly what was going on, as opposed to show, which was so annoying because the author should at least trust their audience to be able to pick up on clues but instead, we get sentences like \"Today Bea turns 30. This is her birthday party. They are here to celebrate\" - this reads as if a bot was made to write prose. <br/><br/>Overall, this book was good for a quick read with lots of mindless twists and if you have a capacity for suspension of disbelief to the highest degree but look too closely at the plot and most of the narrative begins to fall apart to give something clearly implausible.

        "My Review": "When you first click on this book, the top reviews have the following ratings : 3, 1 and 5 despite majority of those of us that read the book having the same takeaways but different interpretations of what the author conveyed. I fully went into the book, thinking I would hate it because for some reason, the reviews convinced me that this book sides with the abuser or tries to sympathise with the man, however, from what I understand of the text - very cleverly written by the author with points that either side of the #MeToo Movement could relate to - I think the broader point that stuck with me after the ending was : Why do women seem to comprehend the gravity of the situation more than men? <br/><br/>We follow two points of views - Margot and Quinn - who established an unlikely friendship about twenty years ago and this story explores the aftermath of accusations piling up against Quin ultimately losing his job while Margot continues to befriend him but is forced to question his seemingly innocent actions. <br/><br/>Quinn was highly unlikable, which is quite a feat to achieve in just about 80 pages, but somehow the author managed to paint him in the worst light ever. He thinks of himself as a practical jester, constantly flirting with women and texting them in times of crisis, however, time and time again, he forgets to respect boundaries, aggravating those around him only adding to their discomfiture. Did he have sex with them? Not quite - however, does it absolve him of passes made  to women either younger than him or those working under him? No. The unequal power dynamic that settles in when someone who contributes to your professional career - only making you walk on eggshells when around them - or someone who can groom you due to the vast age difference  between the two makes all the friendships he pursues dangerous. He has twisted views of the world and while he is painted to be a naive person, I don't think that's quite it. Time and time again, he downplays situations calling the paddle in his office a butter knife, taking women shopping and crossing boundaries with no consent just because he felt it was \"sacred\" and overall making the women around him uncomfortable.  At one point, he refers to sexual abuse incurred by a character as something she did to have comfort the abuser. <br/><br/>Margot was the worst though. I understand that she feels Quinn has saved her life but to what extent do you owe your life to someone that you continue to forgive their missteps at each point? She reeks of preformative activism, writing a book that \"empowers\" women all the while taking delight in saying sexist things to those closest to her. When people bring up the unequal power dynamic, she refers to those women who couldn't say no as infantilized. At one point, she decides women are horses who must be led and want to be led but only in a way that dignifies them. However, she conveniently views each woman through  the lenses of her own experiences, having been able to say No to Quinn when he tried to inappropriately touch her, she believes that each women who accuses him was wrong to not say No or be able to stand their ground.  Unable to sympathise with the variety of situations of the victims, she continues to blame them - oh but you can't call the women witches, according to Margot, although calling them bitches is a-okay. At the end, she wonders whether Quinn should have lost his job and his honour as a human just because of this? Almost as if Quinn didn't breach the honour of his victims but okay. She thinks he should have been a laughing spectacle but not have his job ruined which was just an incredibly unsettling viewpoint to read about",

        "My Review": "The Secret Keeper of Jaipur was one of my most anticipated sequels for 2021 after having read the first book in the series, The Henna Artist, early on in the year. Needless to say, Alka Joshi didn't disappoint as she brings forth a story brimming to the edge with hard-hitting questions of what makes a family and the revelations of internalized prejudices one may hold with class and social standing.<br/><br/>Set against the post-colonial India in early 1960s, we revisit Lakshmi and Malik, twelve years after the ending of THA, who now lead a quiet charmed life in the foothills of Himalayan Mountains at Shimla. Lakshmi has arranged for her protégée who now goes by Abbas Malik to intern with Manu Agrawal back in Jaipur, where work for the Royal Jewel Cinema is on the brink of completion, to learn the reins of business covering all fronts from construction to accounting. Malik finds himself in the throes of a mystery when the balcony for the theatre collapses during intermission, claiming two lives and leaving several wounded. The incident leaves a foul mark on the Palace's reputation who must find a man responsible for the construction as the scapegoat for pleasing public sentiments over the tragedy. However, Malik finds the situation to be amiss after discovering evidences of poor work done in the construction of the columns upholding the balcony in form of a decorative brick.<br/><br/>The stronger aspect of Alka Joshi's writing, for me, is the research that evidently goes into setting up the backdrops for her characters. I left the book with knowledge that no history book has ever taught me before - from the enlightening glimpse into the life of nomadic tribes to the callous ways gold was smuggled across the country for those willing to pay a hefty price after the Gold Act. Reading her books definitely serve to maintain a connection with a version of India that I have never been fortunate enough to witness or read about in the years that I've picked up reading. In addition to this, The Secret Keeper follows THA's footsteps in terms of rich descriptions filled with details of the surrounding, all the way down to the scent a place might have further allowing my own imagination to take flight and settle right at Mall Road of Shimla one minute and the chaotic beauty of Jaipur the next. The nostalgia and warmth I feel for the characters Alka has cultivated always takes me by surprise - so much so I am always rooting for them, smiling one minute at Lakshmi and her headstrongness and shaking my head when they act impulsive.<br/><br/><br/>My only qualms for the books are definitely the characterization of Nimmi and the narrative decisions taken for The Secret Keeper. Coming to my first point, I couldn't find myself caring about Nimmi, whose POVs were sparse by the second half, or begin to understand why she was the way she was.  What bothers me is that she's definitely supposed to be likeable, as is indicative by the prose, but the narrative doesn't her do any favors in terms of likeability every single time she lashed out at Lakshmi about Malik. This was to show us that their relationship was something that mattered a lot to Nimmi, having faced the loss of her husband and her tribe in her past and she was scared to lose Malik too - however, not enough narrative focus was given to their relationship which was wrapped up in a chapter and I didn't get why they even liked each other to actually care about Nimmi's fears. The justification we did get was that Malik liked strong women and that was that. <br/><br/>In ties to my first point, I think we had too many POVs jumbling up the narrative and not allowing there to be a distinctive voice to each of them. At one point, I was reading Malik's POV and thought I was reading Lakshmi's up until the halfway point of the chapter. While I understand Alka's attachment to Lakshmi, a character shaped after her own mother, I do not understand why this book was marketed as Malik's story when Lakshmi felt like the main character at several points with her own POVs dominating that of Malik's by the end. This is a story which could have worked very well with Malik's as the main POV, interspersed sparsely with Lakshmi's, to give the returning reader a taste of the headstrong lady we've come to love all the while acquainting ourselves with a much older and wiser Malik. Perhaps, the story should have introduced us to Malik's life in Shimla first as opposed to meeting him in Jaipur which could have made the reader more invested in his journey. <br/><br/>With that being said, I still think this book shines as one of the better written books I've read this year with a strong plot to hold it through the errs of narrative and characterization. I eagerly await the 3rd book in the series.",

        "My Review": "this novella bothered me almost as much as pip was bothered by the writers of kill joy games, simply because while the mystery was good (and i adored the final theory pip had to offer), she isn't a great character here. her little quips throughout the game were aggravating and a show of her superiority complex which I was bothered by. <br/><br/>Quotes like <br/><i>A good question for once. Pip and her pen waited </i><br/><br/>and <br/><br/><i> but this was really a job for one person. Pip found that – most of the time – other people only slowed you down. </i><br/><br/>And I am going to assume that the reason AGGGTM was a big hit for me was also because hopefully, Pip grew as a character and wasn't this overbearing person I had to read about tonight.",

        "My Review": "rating : 3/5<br/><br/>this sort of a book isn't for me which clouds most of my judgement concerning the same. i thought it was great at the start and it was but the further we delved into the story, the more it got into personal character struggles (which are important!) but to me, the only conflict being one of emotional barriers isn't something i particularly relate to. this was a sweet story of two people who knew each other eons before they met each other and beautifully portrayed the slow process of baring yourself to each other in a relationship, both metaphorically and literally.  With that being said, it didn't really hold my attention to no fault of its own but I skimmed past a lot of the chapters because it bored me and I had no implicit interest in it after a point<br/><br/>edit : i no longer remember this book and it's been only a month.",

        "My Review": "simply had to dnf it after the 10% mark because the inner monologues of the characters are so boring that i couldn't care, however, everyone on twitter was raving about the ending so i did watch it. <br/><br/>very happy to have not read it because it would have made a lousy read - of course, one can't guess the ending of the book when you market it wrong to mislead readers. psychological thriller? yes but when it comes down to it, it's just a <spoiler>paranormal thriller </spoiler>. while that isn't a bad thing, it's a genre of its own and your book entirely hinges on you hiding a pivotal fact, i.e, the genre and that is just not for me. personally, i think it's a cop-out and missed the mark to what could have otherwise, been an intense character study complete with an unreliable narrator.",

        "My Review": "This was a very very comforting read - as someone who grew up in a predominantly Muslim country and celebrated Eid with countless of her classmates throughout the year, this book was a trip down the memory lane. It accurately captured the feeling of Eid I often feel and see reflected in my peers. Every story was just like the dishes you eat on Eid - made at home with lots of love, thought and effort behind it. It was the perfect amount of sweet and wholesome; exploring Eid in so many different situations - some of which broke my heart - but the essence of every story was that Eid is a time when communities come together to heal, celebrate and commemorate their faith. Thank you to all the authors who poured their heart and soul into all these stories and making me feel as if I was a part of all of them, observing a family up the street and smiling in their joy.",

        "My Review": "reading goals for the year: <br/><br/><b> 1. read as i wish to : </b> looking back at my reading pattern throughout the years, whenever i was taking upon a reading challenge, i felt immense pressure to finish that, regardless of whether i was actually enjoying the book. i'd read shortr books i didn't care about just to watch that 100% on my tracker which is a mentality i wish to unsubscribe to in 2021.<br/><br/><b>2. review </b> : in 2020, for the first time, i actively started annotating and keeping notes of the things i read which is something i enjoy and will take ahead with me. however, i had so much to say about books and eventually i'd get lazy and forget to type down reviews. this year, i hope to change that.<br/><br/><b> 3. explore genres i don't usually read </b> : again, i have a specific niche while reading books coming under the umbrella genre of fast paced mystery thrillers but at the end of 2020, i read a few books that i wouldn't normally pick up and i was pleasantly surprised so i'd like to see more of that in 2021",

        "My Review": "<b> Slight spoilers ahead </b> <br/><br/>Upon initially finishing the book, my mind was set on this being a 4.5-stars - mainly because the climax of the plot was satisfying and every character got an arc that felt rightfully deserved. However, the more time I've had to process the character development and the plot itself, it bought the book down to a 2.5-stars.<br/><br/>The first half of the book seems to be in an infinite loop of Alison's mistakes, guilt and her toxic relationship with her husband. It is of no question that the author repeated the same scenario in different settings to emphasize the lack of both Alison's control over alcohol and the slow deterioration of her relationship with her husband. But it could have been done in so many ways. After a point, it was just the author reusing the same plot that she had typed for a good chunk of the book. With no character development to be seen in sight, it felt more like a \"Oh shit, here we go again\". <br/><br/>The synopsis sells itself as a struggling alcoholic whose anchor of hope turns out to be a client suspected of stabbing her husband.  The book doesn't delve further into the murder, having taken a sideline when compared to the car-wreck that is Alison's life.<br/><br/>To top it all off, the threatening texts Alison receives only deters her for a chapter or two, where she decides that she will be more present in her daughter's life only for her to go back to Patrick and repeat her mistakes on a grander scale than before. <br/><br/>The reader is led to believe that her life is moving in a positive upward trajectory (so much so you can almost forget how terrible Carl is) only for it to be a red herring.  <br/><br/>To the book's credit, the last 70 pages made up for the mess in the first half. Each chapter bought forth surprising revelations that alter every character's lives significantly and brings closure to several subplots. The multitude of smaller dramas along the way left me with disbelief at being misled by them.<br/><br/>Overall, there was a huge disjoint in my perception of what the book would be as opposed to what it was. The synopsis painted it as a story containing three over-arching subplots, however, only one of them was fleshed out properly, leading to slippery, poorly framed plots for the other two.<br/><br/>P.S. - were we supposed to believe Alison is good at her job? It was explicitly told to the reader quite a few times, however, just as the rule of \"show, don't tell\" goes, there was no evidence to back it up.",

        "My Review": "<b>Slight Spoilers ahead! Alludes to the ending of the book quite a bit</b><br/><br/>Would you label me a novice if I said I did not see the ending of \"The Silent Patient\" coming? At the ungodly hour of 3 am, when I was definitely supposed to be asleep, I shifted from one side to another in apprehension after reading and re-reading the big twist. Would you label me an amateur if the intricacies of the psychology behind the one responsible for seeking the victim didn't dawn on me until it was laid out in layman's terms?<br/><br/>\r<br/>To be honest, I was fairly surprised by how much I liked this book. Despite the looming warning of an early start to the day, I ended up finishing the book in one sitting, driven by the thrill of Kathy's betrayal and Alicia's silence. <br/>\r<br/>The impact of \"The Silent Patient\" does not come from a fast-paced mystery with twists at every turn, but in the quiet surprises Michaelides sneaks in each page. Michaelides builds the characters from 2-dimensional people, easily categorizable as fundamentally good or bad, to 3-dimensional complex people with motives behind each action stemming from their past. \"The Silent Patient\" shone, particularly, as a riveting character study of both Alicia and Theo, taking its time to reveal us the layers of each character one by one, leading the reader to second-guess their interpretations of what had happened.<br/><br/><br/>Much like the title, the entire book is silent, depending on non-verbal cues via actions and thoughts of our characters as opposed to dialogues for framing the plot. This book is a demonstration of how easy it is to lie to yourself, but your actions will always be a dead giveaway to your deeds. (My apologies, I realize this sentence appears preachy and pretentious)<br/>\r<br/>The author frames the central mystery around Alicia's self-portrait, painted after the murder of her husband, where she depicts herself as Alcestis, giving way to the question about what transpired the night of Gabriel's murder and why was it akin to Alcestis. Having taken upon the role of Alcestis after her husband's death, Alicia has shrouded herself in silence for the past six years and Theo, our protagonist, is of the belief that he can get her to communicate. <br/><br/>Hidden amongst the sessions and the bits of past of our main characters, we are introduced to  the concept of countertransference, in which a therapist becomes emotionally untangled with his patient. Several dialogues and actions alluded to the fast decline of Theo's objectivity regarding Alicia, going above and beyond to put together snippets of Alicia's past, forcing the question to rise - Why? <br/><br/>Could Theo be transferring his feelings of unrequited love onto Alicia? Is Theo actively ignoring the distress in his own life by actively pursuing the truth behind Alicia? Or is there something else at play? <br/><br/>The blurred lines between the roles of therapist and patient hint that Theo and Alicia were linked. Perhaps they are even culpable for the same murder; co-actors in a tragedy akin to Alcestis.<br/><br/>\r<br/><br/>With that being said, the book didn't hit all the spots for me. Several subplots were used as red herrings to distract the reader from the original culprit. However, they were poorly handled with many never being explored again or explained in a way that aligned the motives of those characters.<br/><br/>The psychiatric institution follows procedures unheard of in real life, painting everyone just a little \"mad\" because of their own line of work to excuse actions that would not be looked over. Had the author researched further the functioning of such an institute, especially in the setting he aimed to use it in, this book would have been a 5-star.\r<br/>The very last thing that I would add is the emphasis on accents. Every time the reader was introduced to a new character who wasn't originally from the UK, there was always a bit about the character's accent via dialogues or Theo's POV. While trivial, this kind of annoyed me because there seemed no explicit need of it.",

        "My Review": "Okay so the end of the year is upon us thus, I'll be doing reviews for my favorite books of 2017.<br/>This book was amazing from the start to the finish albeit the descriptions bothered me at wee hours of the night but I made it through because this book was so good. Half of the credit goes to Mark Wagner who ended up this genius smartass and I LOVED IT. He was hilarious and resourceful at appropriate times.<br/>Maybe the science seemed a lot of info for others but honestly that's the other half of why I loved this book. It hooked me in because it held a lot of relevance to something I was studying about and resonated in ways I didn't expect it to.<br/>Overall, it was a brilliant book which was well paced and (in)appropriate at all the right times.<br/>",

        "My Review": "<i> “It’s difficult to live with both hope and grief.” </i><br/><br/>I have to admit that this sort of book and writing style will not appeal or suit to everyone. I had to put it down and pick it up several times to peak any sort of interest but Ingrid's letters got me hooked on what went wrong. <br/>The book is a character-driven novel about love leading to marriage that ultimately was in ruins. Flora and her father are living in the hope that Ingrid would come back while Nan has a more realistic response to the situation and has taken up her mother's place in all the twelve years of disappearance.<br/><br/>The book in itself was alright in the least. We never really explore the emotional aspects hiding within the story even with the use of several metaphors. With that being said, the characters never really grew for me. There were no major developments in their personality aside from the slow realization that Flora's memories were heavily clouded and her realizing that her dad wasn't quite what she made him out to be.<br/> <br/>The letters were enjoyable. The transition of Gil being this charming professor to a compulsive cheater was what struck out for me. I kind of understood why Ingrid never left the relationship since she held on to the hope that they were okay and would overcome this. But after their marriage, they had no connection to speak of. Ingrid didn't want children but she couldn't have used birth control? She gave up so much for someone whom she didn't have an emotional connection to. <spoiler> They never really talked even when Ingrid lost a child </spoiler>. He never really was there for her and used her for acquiring a story he never could have thought of by himself. <br/>The only thing I really felt for this book was intrigue to what happened with Ingrid and anger at her misfortune and Gil's acts.<br/><br/> All books are created by the reader<br/>I really liked the concept behind the running theme of how each reader interprets the book differently. The book left me with a strong message - no two readers read the same book. They define the plot and characters based on what they understand and draw from their experiences.",

        "My Review": "<b> 4 -So close to 5 stars, though </b><br/><br/>Everything in this book, at first, is a BLUR. You don't know what to do or who to suspect and it's all such a huge mess.<br/><br/>The alternating viewpoints did make it a little difficult for me to follow the story and differentiate between the past and the present but the premise of the book delivers.<br/><br/>Rachel is depressed, angry, bitter and DIVORCED. Every day , she passes by a line of sub-urban houses while in the evening and morning train where she pictures the husband and wife- projecting her feelings about her ex and the divorce on to them by creating a seemingly perfect life for the couple.. <br/><br/><spoiler>  She is an alcoholic who doesn't have a job but lies about having one and then suddenly, on a night, she becomes involved with Jess and Jason's life and everything is not what it seems - much to her disappointment. She forgot what happened except the fact that Megan(Jess) is disappeared and she's one of the main suspects.<br/>To prove her innocence and have something to pass her time with,she starts her personal investigation which leads to secrets being revealed and a banging finale.  </spoiler><br/><br/>I am sure that many of us already guessed who was the killer , early on, but Hawkins distracts the readers with further characterization and trivial sub-plots to focus on.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws, the book makes up to be an interesting read.",
